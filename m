Would it be acceptable to simply number the sensors and document which
sensor has which number?

Something like this:
0 = LTD
1 = RTD1
2 = RTD2
3 = RTD3
4 = FAN1
5 = FAN2
6 = FAN3

Would we also want to be able to define PWMs? From what I can tell the
driver does not support running individual pins in GPIO mode, right?
So I'm not quite clear what "disabling PWM" would actually mean.

Anyway, if we simply go by "sensor number", that would mean that we'd
have different attributes depending on the sensor number. Would that
be ok?

Also, I'm sorry, I think I just realized that in "voltage mode" we
don't seem to get a temperature reading. I hadn't actually looked
through more of the datasheet except for the single MODE register
before. But I don't think this makes a difference for what I proposed
so far?

I think I'd like to keep previous behavior unmodified. From what I can
tell previous behavior was:
- xTDs enabled by default
- RTD modes unmodified, i.e. defaulting to whatever the HW comes up with

The NCT7802Y can self-program from an EEPROM, so I assume we should
honor the "power-up configuration" obtained from there? I.e. if no
configuration is provided in the device tree, the driver should use
whatever configuration the chip has when the driver is loaded.

Yes, absolutely. This was a bad example on my part. In my
understanding "label" is just a string that we pass through.
