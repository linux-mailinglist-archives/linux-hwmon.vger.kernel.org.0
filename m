Are you sure you can ever get this stable ? Each fan has its own properties
and tolerances. If you replace a fan in a given system, you might get
different RPM numbers. The RPM will differ widely from system to system
and from fan to fan. Anything that assumes a specific RPM in devicetree
data seems to be quite vulnerable to failures. I have experienced that
recently with a different chip which also tries to correlate RPM and PWM
and fails quite miserably.

In my experience, anything other than minimum fan speed is really a recipe
for instability and sporadic false failures. Even setting a minimum fan speed
is tricky because it depends a lot on the fan.

I am guessing that the "us" refers to the time between pulses from the
fan. I think this is a bad value to start with - anything fan speed
related should really be expressed in RPM, not in time between pulses.

Overall I don't think this should be handled as generic set of properties.
Whatever we come up with as standard set of pwm or fan related properties
should not be an expected correlation between pwm and rpm. Assuming such
a property is needed here (after all, the controller is what it is),
maybe a set of tuples makes sense, such as

	adi,pwm-rpm-map = <
		25, 250,
		50, 500,
		75, 750,
		100, 1000
	>;

though I think that each of those should also include the tolerance
instead of just assuming that a 25% tolerance (as implemented in patch
2/6) would work for all fans.
