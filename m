Not really. Those are two separate issues. The reported and selected
limits are wrong, period. This will require two patches.

Both methods I suggested would have to involve a cache. The question is
when to clear the cache - either clear a bit after reporting it, or
clear it after a timeout.

The timeout would be determined by the chip's conversion rate (register 0x26),
or, for simplicity, just be set to one second. I don't immediately see why
that would be difficult to implement. Not that it matters much, really;
I would accept patches with and without timeout.
