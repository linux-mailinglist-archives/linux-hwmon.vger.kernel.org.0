Hi Rong, Hi Guenter,

Thank you for the review and for pointing out the overlap with lenovo-wmi-o=
ther.

1. WMI Coexistence and Bogus Fans
I completely agree that double-reporting is suboptimal. I will
implement a check in the probe function using
wmi_has_guid(LENOVO_WMI_FAN_GUID). If the WMI interface is present,
yogafan will return -ENODEV and yield to your driver. This ensures my
driver only covers models where WMI reporting is unavailable. I will
also adjust the quirks for the ThinkBook 14 G7+ to avoid registering
bogus fan handles.

2. New Submission Plan and Community Testing
As requested by Guenter, I am preparing a fresh series starting from
[PATCH v1] to provide a clean baseline. This will include the WMI
back-off logic and the Aura Edition (83KF) support.
However, I must be clear: I do not have physical access to the latest
WMI-enabled hardware (like the ThinkBook G7+) to locally verify the
back-off logic. I will provide the V1 with the implemented check, but
I will have to rely on the community=E2=80=94and specifically Rong=E2=80=94=
to test and
verify the behavior on affected models.

3. Authorship and AI Assistance
Regarding the Assisted-by: tag, I want to clarify that the driver
architecture, the design of the RLLag filter, derived from my PhD
research at: https://theses.fr/1998INPG0114, and the overall physical
modeling logic are entirely my original work.
Drawing on my automation background, I validated functional safety and
cybersecurity integrity using a full Bow-Tie Risk Analysis and
Traceability report (following IEC 61508, IEC 61511, and IEC 62443
standards).
 I utilized Gemini as a productivity tool for non-creative, repetitive
tasks: specifically for generating the extensive DMI/ACPI mapping
tables from DSDT data and community-driven reverse engineering of
Lenovo Legion/LOQ EC memory maps at:
https://github.com/hirschmann/nbfc/tree/master/Configs. The full
development history, DSDT research, and hardware analysis are
documented in my repository at:
https://github.com/sergiomelas/lenovo-linux-drivers. I will include
the tag in the next submission to be transparent about the tools used.

Note: I will be traveling to China from April 15th to May 10th. My
connectivity will be limited. I will monitor the mailing list via
mobile roaming to address feedback,  but I will submit the new V1
series early next week, prior to my departure.

Best regards,

Sergio Melas
