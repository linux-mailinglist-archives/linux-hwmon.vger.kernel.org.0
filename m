This call is done only in the governors actually.

Right, so I've been hacking my board, added a pwm-fan and binded the
thermal zone to it.

As expected, the call to thermal_cdev_update() is not needed.

ctx->pwm_fan_state = ctx->pwm_fan_max_state;

intializes to a max value (in my case it is 3). Right after it calls
thermal_cdev_update() which fails to find any instance active because we
are at init time and then calls set_cur_state with the target state set
to zero and passing through a stats usage for nothing.

The ctx->pwm_fan_state is only used by the cooling device ops, so I
don't see any reason why it is set to pwm_fan_max_state before the
compilation condition.

May be there is something subtle here.

Lukasz ? Is there any reason why thermal_cdev_update() was called here ?

IMO, this function is a governor thing and it must be removed from the
cooling device.
