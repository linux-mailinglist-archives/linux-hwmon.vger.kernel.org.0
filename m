Sorry, that is purely hypothetical. Kernel code should not be optimized
for hypothetical situations.

I can see that you are for whatever reason completely opposed to using 
the dmi callback function. Fine, but then don't introduce another one
just to have a callback function and in case it may possibly be needed
sometime in the future. Introduce it if and when it is needed, and only
then. The same applies to all other infrastructure: Introduce it if and
only if it is needed for more than one use case, not because it may be
needed for some unspecified use case some time in the future.
