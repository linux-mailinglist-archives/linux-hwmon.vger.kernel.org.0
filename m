On a side note, suspend code is supposed to be atomic,
If this lock is held, the process or thread holding it
will likely stall suspend since it won't run.
At the very least, this would have to be a trylock,
with suspend failing if the lock can not be acquired.

Sorry, I won't accept "just in case" code.

Having said that, please inform yourself how suspend works. Userland code
has to be stopped before any hardware can be disabled. Similar, hardware
has to be re-enabled before userland code can resume.
Otherwise the kernel would crash all over the place. In many cases,
disabling the hardware means that trying to access hardware registers
will cause an acess fault.

I understand the overflow use case. However, the mere presence
of min/max attributes for energy attributes suggests that this
is not the min/max use case for hwmon attributes. There is no "minimum"
or "maximum" energy for an accumulating value. Such attributes
only make sense in an application abler to measure available 
energy (eg a battery controller). I'll have to read the chip
specification to understand the intended use case.

It sounds like "fault" means something like "one of the past readings
was wrong, but I don't know which one and I don't know if the wrong
value was ever read by user space". Sorry, I fail to see what value
those attributes are supposed to have for the user. At best it could
mean "please re-read the associated attrribute", but that could as well
be accomplished without userspace action if it is really needed.
Also, per datasheet, it looks like the fault bit is set of the chip
voltage is too low. If that happens, the system has a severe problem
which can not be resolved with an attribute visible to userspace.

I can to some degree the logic for energy attributes, but do you really
have an application where the chip is used on a 32-bit system and
monitors power larger than 2kW ?

If you do have such a use case, we'll need to enhance the API
to reflect it.
