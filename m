Thank you for the feedback, I will definitely try to fix those problems if =
I submit it as a patch. What I gather from your response is that it is poss=
ible that such driver is included under drivers/hwmon, correct?

Furthermore, did it help answer the "who is going to maintain the driver af=
ter the initial submission" question of your previous email?

: where should such a driver reside in the source tree? Initially, I though=
t of drivers/hwmon, but that seems to be occupied by drivers for external(?=
) devices (I am not sure, but that is the idea I get). So I am now thinking=
 of drivers/platform/x86. However, I have failed to find any fan hwmon driv=
ers there, so I am not sure about that one, either.
