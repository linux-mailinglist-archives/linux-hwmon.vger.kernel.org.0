Perfect! Thank you for looking at this.

I think that this driver converged into state when it is used by more
non-developer users on LTS -stable kernels as developers which use play
with -rc kernels. So issues or breakages are detected sometimes after
longer time.

Also I think that driver is basically feature-complete so I do not have
reason for investing time in its development.

Currently I have only one Dell laptop and I'm not testing on it kernel
patches as it is used for different daily work and also uses 4.19 LTS
distribution kernel.

But when you send a patch which is larger and needs more testing, I have
no problem to try compile it as module for current distribution kernel
and exchange .ko module at runtime. And test if functionality works as
expected.
