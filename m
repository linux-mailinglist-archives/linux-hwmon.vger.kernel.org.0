I abandoned the project (and dropped the driver from my github page)
because people started _demanding_ that I push the driver from github
upstream, without offering any assistance whatsoever.

IT8686 is a multi-page chip, meaning you'll need the entire protection
against multi-page accesses by the EC in the system. It also supports
the new temperature map. I don't think it is that simple.
