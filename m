Apparently, eSPI has been around for a while. Didn't know that, it's
been quietly replacing
LPC starting from 2015.

I've been doing even more digging, this time on github. Should have
done this sooner.
What I found is that for the LibreHardwareMonitor Project that 0xd802
ID is a new chip!

<https://github.com/LibreHardwareMonitor/LibreHardwareMonitor/pull/846>
They call it "NCT6799D".
I guess, I'll ask there, because I do have photos of the chip on the mainboard
with the "NCT6796D-S" label on it. (The SuperIO is located behind the GPU).

Your suggestion: "Look at the Windows Utility" was very helpful in this regard.
So ASRock has each motherboard configurations in a separate .xml file.
And the content of that ASRock XML for my motherboard does make sense.
My best guess is that, I have to spend more time at driver, the missing fans
should have been fan4 and fan5.

=> Adding the ID isn't enough to get this supported just yet. For the
time being if someone
wants to use this: Please just stick with the force_id module
parameter. I ask Nuvoton (apparently
they have a github page) or try to figure this out by looking more at
the windows utility.

Thank you!

Christian

PS.: As luck would have it, I also got an ASRock B660M PG board. This has
the "NCT6796D-R". However this chip reuses the existing NCT6796D ID and is
instantly working with 6.1-rc4.
