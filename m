I am somewhat relieved that these issues are not so silly.  And I really
appropriate your comments.

Please take a look at a few more comments bellow.

We can never read the pwm[1-*] attributes, not even for detected and
controllable fans after the initialization procedure.

And returning -ENODATA for pwm[1-*] reads makes pwmconfig/fancontrol
unhappy:

# pwmconfig
[...]
Found the following PWM controls:
cat: hwmon0/pwm1: No data available
   hwmon0/pwm1           current value: 
cat: hwmon0/pwm1: No data available
/bin/pwmconfig: line 201: [: : integer expression expected
cat: hwmon0/pwm1: No data available
hwmon0/pwm1 stuck to 
Manual control mode not supported, skipping hwmon0/pwm1.
[...]

# fancontrol
[...]
Enabling PWM on fans...
cat: hwmon0/pwm1: No data available
Starting automatic fan control...
/bin/fancontrol: line 551: read: read error: 0: No data available
Error reading PWM value from /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/pwm1
Aborting, restoring fans...
cat: hwmon0/pwm1: No data available
/bin/fancontrol: line 458: [: : integer expression expected
hwmon0/pwm1_enable stuck to 1
Verify fans have returned to full speed

Yes, as well as your suggestion bellow.

It worked really well, thanks!

You're right, but setting its visibility to 0444 didn't cause issues for
pwmconfig or fancontrol, so I don't think the trick is necessary here.

Ok.
