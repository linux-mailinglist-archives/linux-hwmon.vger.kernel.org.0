G'day all,

As has been recently documented on loads of Mac forums, it turns out that some older Macbook hardware can set the SMC to stop charging at an arbitrary battery charge level.
On supported machines this is the BCLM SMC key. I've also found that on my MacbookPro 11,1 the BFCL key sets the threshold at which the SMC changes the charging led from orange to green (that doesn't seem to be documented anywhere).

On my machine I set them to 4b & 4a respectively, and the battery stops charging at ~75% and the led goes green. I boot into OSX and use smcutil to set this, but it sticks until either a firmware update or SMC reset and hasn't caused an issues in Linux with suspend or hibernate for the month or so I've had it working.

I've been considering adding this to the applesmc driver, but as it tends to take me inordinate amounts of time to do this stuff I thought I'd ask before I start :

- Would it likely be accepted?
- Apple seems to set BFCL at ~5% less than BCLM. Would it be policy to do similarly arbitrary, or should the keys be exposed independently?

I'm happy to do a bit of work and put some patches forward, but I'd rather gauge interest and get some direction before I start.

My VAIO had this 10 years ago so it's nice to see Apple catch up, even if the functionality has been there but hidden for years.

Regards,
Brad
