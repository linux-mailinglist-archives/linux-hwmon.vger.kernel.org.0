Hmm, did you read the comments in the driver? I warn about writing nonsense
values to the micro-controller because you can make it stall. If I let you
access the device by hidraw I assume you know what you are doing. You
actually can damage your PSU by this, something I also warn about. I even
mention that I may remove the hidraw feature in future versions.

corsair-psu is a hwmon driver, not a gadget driver. This driver does not
have to provide hidraw, only hwmon api access. The hidraw is just a nice
to have feature. And like my query tool shows, you actually don't need the
driver to query it from userspace. The first prototypes of the driver did
locking in the hidraw part which sometimes resulted in lockups. I will
not increase complexity for a nice-to-have feature. So the only option is,
I remove the feature if it causes trouble.

Guenter, what do you think?

greetings,
Will
