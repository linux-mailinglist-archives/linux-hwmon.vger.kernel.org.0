Ok. I think this is the one item that has shown up in the discussion that
makes an argument this is a lot more general purpose than the name would
suggest and so possibly should be an IIO driver.

It is a fairly slow ADC though at only 8ksps so not sure how general
purpose these actually are but the potential is there.
