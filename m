Exactly. There is no guarantee that page 0 is selected.

No, it is not reliable. The driver is simply not usable in this scenario.
This isn't just the temperature sensor code - the eeprom code is affected
as well.

I thought that was disabled. The i801 driver is supposed to detect if write
protect is enabled and, if so, it is supposed to not instantiate the spd5118
driver for DDR3. Support for this was added with commit 4d6d35d3417d ("i2c:
smbus: introduce Write Disable-aware SPD instantiating functions"). Apparently
the code to do this never made it into the i801 driver.

The i801 driver needs to be fixed to inform the spd initialization code
that the spd5118 address range is write protected. The patch to do this was
"i2c: i801: Do not instantiate spd5118 under SPD Write Disable". I have no idea
why that patch didn't make it upstream.
