No one should have absolute path names like the above in their tools.
So far none of the driver conversions caused trouble, so hopefully
we should be fine.

Yes, we should add hwmon_intrusion to hwmon_sensor_types, with _alarm
and _beep as supported attributes.

We'll have to keep sysfs files for those for the time being,
unless there are some which are officially listed in
Documentation/hwmon/sysfs-interface.rst.

Good start. I would suggest to run your patch through checkpatch.
It will tell you, for example, that S_IRUGO et al ran out of favor,
and that you are supposed to use octals instead.
