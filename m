Thank you very much for the patch, Guenter Roeck!

I just compiled it using the mainline Kernel as a basis, but 
"sensors-detect" still claims there are no sensors detected on my ASUS 
TUF GAMING X670E-PLUS WIFI.

Trying family `VIA/Winbond/Nuvoton/Fintek'...               Yes
Found unknown chip with ID 0xd802
     (logical device B has address 0x290, could be sensors)

dmesg yields the following output:

[  465.372161] nct6775: Found NCT6799D or compatible chip at 0x2e:0x290
[  465.372166] ACPI Warning: SystemIO range 
0x0000000000000295-0x0000000000000296 conflicts with OpRegion 
0x0000000000000290-0x0000000000000299 (\RMTW.SHWM) (20221020/utaddress-204)
[  465.372170] ACPI: OSL: Resource conflict; ACPI support missing from 
driver?

So the driver definitely works and recognizes the chip. Any idea why 
lm-sensors can't access it?

Thanks,
Sebastian
