True, that's a fair point.

nct6775-core.c currently has DEFAULT_SYMBOL_NAMESPACE #defined to 
HWMON_NCT6775 (and the platform and i2c drivers are using 
MODULE_IMPORT_NS(HWMON_NCT6775)), so I think that's already in place -- 
I guess we can just leave it as is with the patch that's now upstream 
then.
