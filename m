The chip parameter covers all standard hwmon sysfs attributes. A hwmon driver
without standard sysfs attributes is not a hwmon driver. It abuses the hwmon
subsystem and its API/ABI. If I catch such a driver, I'll NACK it. If I find
one in the kernel, I will do my best to get it removed.

I would suggest to read the hwmon API more closely to understand it. Your claim
that "the chip parameter is of no use to us" is simply wrong, as should be obvious
when you read this submission. Actually, if you would convert the other
drm drivers to use it, it would reduce the size of the hwmon specific code
in those drivers, typically by 20-40%. Given that, I must admit that I am quite
baffled by your claim. Maybe you could explain that in more detail.

Of course, I care about use of the hardware monitoring subsystem
outside drivers/hwmon. Unlike other maintainers, I let people register drivers
from outside that directory, but that doesn't mean that I don't care.

FWIW, you are close to convincing me to add a warning message to the kernel
to tell users of deprecated hwmon APIs that the API is deprecated.
Alternatively, I may stop permitting new hwmon drivers outside drivers/hwmon.
