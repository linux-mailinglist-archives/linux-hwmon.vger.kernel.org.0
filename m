Hello compliments of the season. I hope that you and your loved ones
are protected from the corona-virus pandemic. My name is Richard
Mckenzie, I have emailed you earlier on without any response from you.
In my first email I mentioned about my late client Daniel, whose
relatives I cannot get in touch with regarding the recovery of his
deposit with a Finance Firm, but both of you have the same last name
so it will be very easy to front you as his official next of kin. I am
compelled to do this because I don't want the finance house to push my
client=E2=80=99s funds into their treasury as unclaimed inheritance. Kindly
get back to me to my official email. ( mckenzierichard642@gmail.com )
at your earliest, so that I can give you comprehensive details on what
we are to do.

Sincerely,
Richard Mckenzie.
