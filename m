The AS621x is a digital temperature sensor chip with an I2C interface. It h=
as applications in electronic equipment, personal computers, wearables, and=
 HVAC. The datasheet can be found here: https://ams.com/documents/20143/360=
05/AS621x_DS000677_4-00.pdf

I wish to write a driver for this device and contribute it to the kernel, a=
s my first module. It being my first module, I wanted to make sure that thi=
s was a worthy use of everyone's time and that it could be useful at some p=
oint. Sparkfun provides a convenient breakout board already, which is the o=
ne that I will be using.

After searching through the mailing list archive, I found a set of patches =
from 2016 for the AS6200 as part of the iio subsystem. For reasons I could =
not find, the driver never got merged. I guess the original developers move=
d on to something else. Additionally, they were discussing towards the end =
how the hwmon subsystem may have been a better fit for the driver. Therefor=
e, I wanted to hear everyone's thoughts on writing this driver before I get=
 started on it. From what I can tell, it does not seem much more complex th=
an some other temperature sensor drivers in the kernel, such as the tmp102.

Joe Strauss
