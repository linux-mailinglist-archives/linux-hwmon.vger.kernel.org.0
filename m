I initially considered exposing SPD write-protection as a capability to be
consumed by spd5118.
However, spd5118 already depends on firmware-initialized state (page
selection) and cannot reliably
determine safe operation at probe time without issuing writes.
Given that, suppressing SPD instantiation in the i801 driver when SPD Write
Disable is
the only solution here.

Tested the remaining patch [1], and it does not seem to fix the issue, as
it is added at the wrong stage
in the initialization of the i801 driver. The attached log shows that
spd5118 is instantiated and fully probed
before the "do not instantiate spd5118 under SPD Write Disable" is acted
upon.
This confirms that suppressing instantiation must occur before adapter
registration in i801.
Once the adapter is registered, the SPD scan has already happened, and
spd5118 has bound successfully
based on the firmware-initialized state, even though correct operation is
impossible.
Therefore, the fix must be run prior to adapter registration.

te-v2-2-2f54d91ae2c7@canonical.com/


The fix is to register the SPD write-disable policy before
i2c_add_adapter(), so the I2C core never
probes SPD addresses on write-protected platforms.

,<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry, I seem to be=

t; In that case, what is the point of patch 3/3 of your series which<br>&gt=
; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; removes hardware accesses from the suspend function =
?<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You are right to question this, and I agree that=
 it needs clarification.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =
Patch 3/3 was originally proposed under the assumption that the resume fail=
ures<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; were caused by spd5118 performing I2C transac=
tions while the<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; controller was not yet available,<=
br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and that removing hardware accesses from the suspe=
nd path might<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mitigate the issue.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;=
&gt;&gt; At that point, I assumed the problem was limited to the resume cal=
lback.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; After enabling det=
ailed i801 debug logging and testing with<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; SET_LATE=
_SYSTEM_SLEEP_PM_OPS() in the i801 driver,<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it beca=
me clear that this assumption was incorrect. The controller<br>&gt; &gt;&gt=
;&gt;&gt; itself reports &quot;i801_smbus: No response&quot;<br>&gt; &gt;&g=
t;&gt;&gt; both during suspend and immediately after resume, and spd5118 me=
rely<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; propagates the resulting -ENXIO.<br>&gt; &gt;=
&gt;&gt; Outch, that really hurts, because it means that something is serio=
usly<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; broken in both the suspend and resume path. The d=
evice _must_ be accessible<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; in the suspend path. Otherw=
ise there is no guarantee that the device is<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; accessibl=
e for normal (pre-suspend) operation. After all, someone could<br>&gt; &gt;=
&gt;&gt; run a script reading sysfs attributes in a tight loop continuously=
,<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; or the thermal subsystem could try to access the chi=
p. That would suddenly<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; start to fail if something in t=
he device access path starts to be suspended<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; while the=
 underlying hardware is still believed to be operational.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&=
gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I could imagine some hack/quirk for the resume pat=
h, such as delaying resume<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; for some period of time for=
 affected hardware, but I have no idea what to<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; do on t=
he suspend side. We can not just drop device writes during suspend<br>&gt; =
&gt;&gt;&gt; because some broken hardware/firmware does not let us actually=
 access<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; (and thus suspend) the hardware anymore by the=
 time the suspend function<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; is called.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;=
&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Guenter<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=
&gt; This indicates that the issue is not caused by spd5118 suspend/resume<=
br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; behavior, but by the unavailability of the<br>&gt;=
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; SMBus controller due to platform or firmware interactions=
 during<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; s2idle transitions.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&g=
t;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Given this, I agree that patch 3/3 does not add=
ress the root cause and<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; does not provide a justifi=
ed improvement.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am therefore fine with dropping =
it.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you for pointin=

gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks for the continued review and for questionin=
g the earlier<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; direction =E2=80=94 that helped narrow this =
down properly.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; After enabling full i801 d=
ebug logging (included below in this email)<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; and inspecting=
 both drivers, it became clear that the resume<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; failures ar=
e not caused by spd5118 accessing the hardware too<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; early, =
nor by PM ordering issues. Instead, the SMBus controller<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; e=
xplicitly reports =E2=80=9CSPD Write Disable is set=E2=80=9D, and any<br>&g=
t; &gt;&gt; block write transactions to the SPD device consistently fail wi=
th<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; DEV_ERR. spd5118 merely propagates the resulting -ENXIO=
.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Oh no, this likely happens even when merely rea=
ding values, as the spd5118<br>&gt; &gt; uses a page register to switch bet=
ween different register pages. In order<br>&gt; &gt; to access temperature =
data (page 0), you might already have to issue a<br>&gt; &gt; write access =
to the page register. The only reason why it works for you<br>&gt; &gt; is =
that the spd5118 likely already has page 0 selected by the system firmware<=
br>&gt; &gt; during boot.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Exactly. There is no=
 guarantee that page 0 is selected.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; With that in m=
ind, I have dropped the earlier patch that attempted<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; to re=
move hardware access from the suspend path<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; unconditionally=
.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; That patch does not address the root cause and is no lon=
ger<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; part of the series.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; =
I am instead proposing a minimal 2-patch series:<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &=
gt;&gt; 1/2 records whether the platform enforces SPD write disable at prob=
e<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; time (no behavior change).<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; 2/2 avoids r=
egcache writeback during suspend/resume when the device<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; op=
erates in read-only mode, while still allowing read access to<br>&gt; &gt;&=

ng SMBus transactions that are architecturally<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; blocked on =
these systems, and does not rely on<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; delays or PM ordering =
assumptions, and leaves behavior unchanged on<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; platforms wh=
