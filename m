I experimented by configuring the driver to observe
SPD5118_REG_I2C_LEGACY_MODE and SPD5118_REG_TEMP_CONFIG registers
before suspend and immediately after resume, prior to any
driver-initiated writes.
Across multiple suspend-to-idle cycles, register values remained unchanged,
indicating that the SPD5118 does not lose configuration and
does not require reprogramming of legacy/16-bit mode on resume.
Resume failures correlate with temporary I2C unavailability rather
than loss of device state.

Since the device configuration remains intact across resume and the
failure correlates with I2C availability,
restoring SPD5118_REG_I2C_LEGACY_MODE is neither required nor justified.
For this reason, I agree that restoring this register would be unsafe
without broader platform testing.
