I see.

I tried to drill down and see the history of the driver and in the
original commit all values are scaled with the function
get_temp_mC() which indicates that the driver has always
intended to return millicentigrades, not unscaled values (as
far as I can tell).

First commit 9e8269de100dd0be1199778dc175ff22417aebd2
"hwmon: (ntc_thermistor) Add DT with IIO support to NTC thermistor driver"
adds the result  >>= 12 thing on top of a raw IIO read,
so here is a silent assumption of a 12 bit ADC.

Then commit 0315253b19bbc63eedad2f6125c21e280c76e29b
"hwmon: (ntc_thermistor) fix iio raw to microvolts conversion"
calls iio_convert_raw_to_processed() to get around the 12
bit assumption, instead adding a 1000x scale assumption
on the value passed in from the raw read. This just looks
wrong, why would it be 1000 and not 1 like the IIO core does
when we call iio_read_channel_processed()? It looks like it is
actually compensating for a bug in the ADC returning
the wrong scale: the author may have used a buggy ADC
driver return a scaling to volts instead of millivolts and then this
was a trial-and-error solution to that bug in the ADC
driver.

In that case it would be nice to know which ADC driver,
so we can fix it! I suspect maybe an out-of-tree ADC?

So there is first a hardcoded solution to handle raw 12 bit
values and then a trial-and-error fix for 1000x scaling in the
code that was supposed to make it generic.

The actual situation I have is that I used the thermistor for a thermal
zone, and AFAICT these require that the temperature be in millicelsius,
at least it will be very hard to handle the thermal zone in the device
tree that define the trip points in millicelsius, so since the driver sets
HWMON_C_REGISTER_TZ it might break
the thermal zone ABI rather than the hwmon/sensors ABI, right?

At least commit c08860ffe5c0e986e208e8217dae8191c0b40b24
"hwmon: (ntc_thermistor) Add ntc thermistor to thermal subsystem as a sensor"
adds a thermal zone calling the function get_temp_mc()
clearly requiring a millicentigrade measure.

I also think it is indeed resulting in millicelsius on the platform that
commit 0315253b19bbc63eedad2f6125c21e280c76e29b
is intended for, it's just that it fixes a bug in the wrong place...

I don't know if the patch is especially messy but this part inside
the if (ret < 0) clause:

shold be identical to the original fallback.

If you want me to revise the patch in some way, I can fix, to me
it looks like the fallback will just work on a certain platform with
erroneous 1000x offset scaling, it would be good to know which
one so we can fix the actual problem.

Yours,
