Hi Guenter,

Thanks for your detailed elaboration. It's very helpful.

Understood. I will squash the two patches into a single patch, as it
will only provide hwmon ABI.

Thanks for clarification. I am not going to support this, as dancing
with undocumented ROM/RAM access is too dangerous.

>=20

The witrn driver itself is less than 700 LOC. It's longer because of
more channels and the need to call floating-point conversion and
arithmetic methods.

Other LOC mostly locates at the floating-point conversions and
arithmetic module. Since I will turn it into a generic lib, it won't be
a part of the witrn driver when I resubmit it. Thanks for the
suggestion.

The include file is for the floating-point conversion and arithmetic
module.

I should have explained the structure of the series more detailedly.
Sorry for causing the misunderstanding.

Thanks for clarification. I think the feature has nothing to do with
UCSI because it's a passive dumb raw packet sniffer.

Agreed. I am not going to support it in any other subsystem either.
Users should use hidraw and parse everything themselves if they need it.
