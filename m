That is exactly why I had added to flag in the out-of-tree driver.

Sorry, I'd rather live with 100 users mad with me for not permitting
the patch than permitting it and having to deal with one user who
ended up with broken hardware or random reboots. This _has_ to be a
conscious decision made by users.

Also, ignoring ACPI resource conflicts always was and always will be risky.
There is no such thing as a "known safe board". Who knows what Gigabyte
is going to do in the next version of their BIOS.
