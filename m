Actually, uevents are send and can be received as is. I have tried 
changing the kobject for kobject_uevent(), too, and only the content of 
the uevent changes.
Since I don't know what would be the "right" one, I left it as is.
If you say, that it would be correct with the hwmon_dev kobject, I'll 
add this to the patch.
