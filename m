It being my first module, I wanted to make sure that this was a worthy use of everyone's time and that it could be useful at some point. Sparkfun provides a convenient breakout board already, which is the one that I will be using.

I guess the original developers moved on to something else. Additionally, they were discussing towards the end how the hwmon subsystem may have been a better fit for the driver. Therefore, I wanted to hear everyone's thoughts on writing this driver before I get started on it. From what I can tell, it does not seem much more complex than some other temperature sensor drivers in the kernel, such as the tmp102.

If you look really closely, you'll notice that the chip is LM75 compatible.
Except for the resolution it seems to be fully compatible to TPM112.
Given that, there is no need for a new driver. Extending the lm75 driver
should be sufficient.
