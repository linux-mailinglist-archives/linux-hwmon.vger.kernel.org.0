A few, but they are all more or less unlikely.

- Debian might carry some non-upstream driver patches causing the problem
   (or fixing it in the older kernel, and the patch was not applied to the
   new kernel).
- Debian installs its own version of the CPU firmware, and the version
   installed with the newer kernel introduces the problem.
   Normally the BIOS would update the CPU firmware, but that may not be
   the case for older systems.
- The problem is caused by some change in the kernel outside the
   fam15h_power driver. I can not imagine what that might be, but it is
   a possibility.

You should be able to check the first two possibilities. For the last one,
the only means I could think of would be to bisect between the good and
the bad version.
