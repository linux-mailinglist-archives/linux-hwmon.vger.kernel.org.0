Using the minimum fan speed as detection mechanism for fan failures is ok
and widely used. My concern is the desire to associate it with pwm values.

As I said above, it would be perfectly fine to have a parameter that reflects
minimum fan speed (or, translated into chip speak, minimum number of pulses
per minute).

Sure, I'll take it, as long as you find a binding that is acceptable for Rob.
It is your funeral, after all :-).
