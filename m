Testing and, more importantly, detailed code review. No one but me has
seriously (if at all) scrutinized that code for years. Just picking it
into mainline and hope that it won't cause trouble is, by itself, troublesome.

On top of that, the multi-page access problems are well known by board vendors
using this chip as well as by the chip vendor. Yet, neither board vendors nor
ITE talk with kernel developers. The workarounds I implemented are based on
information I got from one of the Windows tools developers, and are not
validated by any board vendor nor by ITE. Every board vendor I tried to contact
tells me that they don't support Linux, and I never got any reply from ITE.
I do know that the code causes problems on early Gigabyte board using the 8686
and similar multi-page chips. Just accessing the chip from Linux may cause trouble
because the built-in EC tries to access it as well in parallel (I suspect this
causes the board to reset because that access is turned off for a while by
the driver). This is all fine for an out-of-tree driver, but it would be
unacceptable in the upstream kernel.

In summary, you'll not only need to port the code, you'll also need to establish
contact to ITE and/or to board vendors to ensure that the code works as intended
with the EC on the affected boards.
