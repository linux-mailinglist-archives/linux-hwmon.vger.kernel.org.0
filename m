I see your point.  Although, apart from this rather serious quirk, these
devices work really well with pwmconfig/fancontrol.

Well, in this particular case, the driver must reinitialize the device
anyway, since it cannot know whether the device was already initialized.
Maybe the driver was removed because the device itself was disconnected
and powered off (it's a USB device, not a chip on a board).

So in the work-in-progress driver I take this opportunity to also make
sure that its state matches the device's, and force all fans to their
default PWM values after powering on.

Specifically, besides requesting the device to initialize itself, I also
(re)set all fans to 40% PWM.  (This does not require waiting for the
initialization to be complete).

Is this egregious?

Thanks,
Jonas
