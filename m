Agreed; I found the same problem. I actually tried to implement support
for an attribute to support the window registers, but could not find
working settings. I only played with window registers, though, so we'll
probably need attributes for both window mode and pwm rate of change.

Agreed.

Only reason for me to omit that was because it was buggy (FWIW, I didn't
know either that the defalt caching mode is "do not cache", and that all
the 'volatile' declarations were useless).
