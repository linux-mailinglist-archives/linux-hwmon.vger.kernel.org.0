Correct, those were typos. Adding the 6799 based on closest number.

Ok, I'll focus on figuring out the registers for the connected sensors 
or finding a datasheet.

In theory, ACPI access is faster because WMI is an extra translation
layer on top, but at the same time nct6775 doesn't have to worry about 
finding the right device or registering with ACPI.

Did you mean to skip the WMI path, skip the WMBD control method and go 
straight for the read/write methods themselves? That's possible.

The tricky bit would be narrowing down which PNP0C14 device has those 
methods and then trying not to compete with the other WMI/EC drivers for 
Asus sensors (too many: asus-wmi-sensors, asus_atk0110, asus-ec-sensors)

I know the _UID for the board I have, but this probably shouldn't rely 
on _UIDs and have to cover all 50 boards that are already there.

Let me have a look at this.

Thanks, I didn't know that was there.
