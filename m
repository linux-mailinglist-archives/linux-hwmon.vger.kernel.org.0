The problem is that PMBus does not define VID mode values. If it did, we
could add vrm version detection detection to the pmbus core. 0x01 for
TPS53679 _may_ be the same as 0x01 for XDPE122xxx, or maybe not.
There is no way to be sure without datasheets.

Doesn't the datasheet have something to say ?

I am quite neutral on that. I am much more concerned with the assumption
that the mode values have the same meaning for chips from different
vendors. In this case, what do we do if TI starts shipping a chip
in the TPS53xxx series which uses mode 0x10 for something else ?

Overall I'd rather play safe and add a separate driver for the
Infineon chips.
