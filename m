The 1.5 second duration comes from this line in nct6775_update_device():

   if (time_after(jiffies, data->last_updated + HZ + HZ / 2)

Each 'HZ' represents one second, so HZ + HZ / 2 = 1.5 sec; if you want 
to lengthen it you could do e.g. 10 * HZ or something instead.

Though as Guenter noted, one other possibility is that with the previous 
(buggy) version nct6775_update_device() might never have gotten called 
at all -- do you know if that might be the case on your system?  (i.e.  
do you have any userspace monitoring program or the like that would have 
been reading from the nct6775 device's sensors?)  If something like that 
never ran between the driver getting loaded and the system suspending, 
that might also (partially) explain things; to test that out you could 
revert to the old buggy code and see if the suspend problem still occurs 
if you explicitly run

   $ cat /sys/bus/platform/drivers/nct6775/nct6775.*/hwmon/hwmon*/*_input

(or just 'sensors' if you've got the lm-sensors package installed).  That will
ensure that nct6775_update_device() gets called before the suspend 
operation, which could help narrow things down further.


Thanks,
Zev
