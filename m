The screens don't turn on during this timeframe, so I can't see any useful log messages.

> Guenter, it looks like nct6775_suspend() really does in fact need to use nct6775_update_device() instead of dev_get_drvdata(), though it's not immediately obvious to me why.  Though given that the bulk of of the body of nct6775_update_device() is inside an 'if' block that might not necessarily execute every time, I also wonder if it might be vulnerable to exhibiting the same problem depending on timing.

It isn't obvious to me either except ... is it possible that nct6775_update_device()
was never called (ie that the 'sensors' command was never executed) ?
That might just possibly explain the problem because in that case the values
restored in the resume() function were actually never read from the chip.

> Zoltán, if you could try another experiment to try to gather some data on that -- with the patch from my previous email still applied, could you try suspending via:
