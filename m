Hi Guenter,

I didn't think about such possibility.
It sounds promising.

So, we can add our platform driver to "drivers/platform/mellanox",
which can:
- fetch "vrm" mapping per each relevant device.
- for each allocate device node, create properties table with vrm mode
 mapping like "vrm-mode-vr11", "vrm-mode-vr12", "vrm-mode-vr13",
 "vrm-mode-imvp9", "vrm-mode-amd625mv", coded accordingly to
 "enum vrm_version".
- attach this node to "i2c_board_info" and instantiate it with
  i2c_new_device() for "pmbus" type.=20

And i"pmbus" will get these properties like
device_property_read_8(dev, "vrm-mode-vr11")) etcetera.

Did I get your suggestion correctly?

Thanks,
Vadim.
