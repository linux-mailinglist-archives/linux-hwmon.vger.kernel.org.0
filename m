I have forwarded the patch to the Fedora users experiencing the issue, 
one seems to currently try it. I will let you know if I get a feedback

The major issue is a wrong output of battery power percentage (in one case it gets stuck, in the other cases is becomes erratic). Also, in one case it has effects on suspending (see the report).
