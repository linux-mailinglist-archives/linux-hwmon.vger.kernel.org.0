libgpiod has the upside of offering you to set the pull down and open

If another device tree node uses:

foo-gpios =3D <&gpio0 5 (GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH|GPIO_OPEN_DRAIN)>;

The result will be that gpiolib will emulate open drain.

From userspace libgpiod can do the same request.

We just specify the line in the device tree, and we just use it as
intended in the
driver, if it is present, whether that is as input or output.

We do not try to over-protect users from misusing GPIO lines that have just
one possible (electronic defined) mode. It would be over-engineering IMO.

No just write some default set-up into the registers, that's fine.
Or leave the power-on defaults.

The just return an error code for any other GPIO where this is called.

If a pins .direction_output() fails, .set_value() will not be called
on it either.

Open drain-only pins would be pins that can be set to electric LOW (grounde=
d)
or High-Z. Is this what we have?

That's indeed a bit of an oddity...

If you implement .set_config and handle PIN_CONFIG_DRIVE_OPEN_DRAIN
for these lines then I think gpiolib will do the right thing for you.
