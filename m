Ok, so I just did a quick duckduckgo for this and it looks like
you are right.

Ack reading up on this it seems the idea is not to connect the external
charger directly to the battery to allow fast-charging without
the charge-IC inside the device adding heat, which is the traditional
bypass mode.

Instead the whole battery + charging-IC are cut out of the circuit
(so bypassed) and the charger is now directly powering the device
without the battery acting as a buffer if the power-draw superseeds
what the external charger can deliver.

Hmm this new bypass mode indeed does seem to mirror inhibit charge
from a user pov, but it does more. It reminds me of the battery disconnect
option which some charge-ICs have which just puts the battery FET in
high impedance mode effectively disconnecting the battery. Now that
feature is intended for long term storage of devices with a builtin
battery and it typically also immediately powers off the device ...

Still I wonder if it would make sense to add a new "disconnect"
charge_behaviour or charge_types enum value for this ?

Is suspend awake though ?

Well you say no charging is done when suspended, the question also is what
behavior do we want here?  I'm fine with the default behaviour, but a case
could be made that charging while suspended might be desirable (dependent on
the use case) in which case we would need to disable the inhibit when
suspending to get the desired behavior.

Also what if other firmware interfaces with a bypass^W inhibit option work
differently and do charge during suspend ?

It is important that we clearly define the expected behavior now so that
future devices can be made to behave the same.

Regards,

Hans
