I really have to pass on this one, and leave it up to Rob to decide.
Personally I really really really dislike raw values, but I understand
that this makes me biased. I do realize that converting from a fractional
value to a register value is inherently complex and open to interpretation.
For example. if we define fractional values, what should 1.007000 translate
to ? It would either be 1.008 or 1.004641. Using the register value (0xff,
or -1 for 1.004641) would definitely be simpler and avoid calculations and
rounding.
