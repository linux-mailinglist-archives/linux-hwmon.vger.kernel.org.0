I'm surprised that your bypass is working! That check is intended to make it
safe to assume HPBIOS_BIOSNumericSensor.Name is a ACPI_TYPE_STRING. Which the
driver continues to do, of course.

Maybe .Name is being erroneously reported as an ACPI_TYPE_BUFFER on just that
model, but is in reality still a string? Dealing with that string in e.g.
hp_wmi_strdup() would still work because .string.pointer and .buffer.pointer
seem to end up at the same offset in a union acpi_object, at least for now.

Could you share output from acpidump and sensors before we go any further?

Thanks.
