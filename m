Most of the users do not like something like 'low  = -273.1°„C' or 
'high = +65261.8°„C' that just seem noise, or software bug, or hardware
error, and that will cause unnecessary worry.

We can support more HWMON_T_MIN and HWMON_T_MAX for advanced 
user iff a valid configure value in the futher, and without any noise.
