Well ok, looks like this:

      temperature-offset-millicelsius:
        description: Temperature offset to be added to or subtracted from remote temperature measurements.
        items:
          items:
            type: integer
            minimum: -128000
            maximum: 127000

Will overwrite the definition...most likely just minimum: -128000 in 2nd items will be enough.
