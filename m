Hi,


Thank you for offering to coach me!  You are right, I don't have
experience of writing kernel drivers at all.  I would like to be
coached by you.  I have a system with an tmp75b device to test with.

At the moment I haven't been given any project to work in. so I decided
to work in this driver.  We were using this driver and I wanted
to give a boost to it, while I learn more about the kernel drivers.
However I am open to any suggestions you might have, although If I am
given a new project I won't be able to work on this as much as now.

Thanks for your feedback and for offering to coach me,

Iker
