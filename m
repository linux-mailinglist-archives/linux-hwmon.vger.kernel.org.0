Actually I thaught about it, that was my first idea.

There is tiny difference between the 2 approach:
* A regulator that does not provide enable()/disable() is considered
always-on, so it is not really checked if it is enabled or not
* A regulator that does provide enable()/disable() but disallow status
change will be checked with is_enabled()

In the second case, we will pick up on regulator that is disabled and we
can't enable. In the first case, I don't think we do. I don't know if it
is a bug of not but that makes the 2nd case more correct for what we do
with pmbus regs I think

The other thing, although is more a pmbus implemantion consideration,
is that the type regulator is opaque in
pmbus_regulator_register. Different types could be registered so
manipulating the ops is tricky. That's where a callback is helpful 

If building the ops dynamically is the preferred way, I'll find a way to
make it happen. I'll need to way to identify which one need it, loose
the 'const' qualifier in a lot of place, etc ... that will be a bit
hackish I'm afraid.

At the moment, it does not. With this patch it might but only a
registration. We've been discussing other modes but it would not impact
regulator I think.
