Ah, thank you for your detailed explanation.  How you did as much as
you did is beyond me.  ITE's web site seems to lack any usable
information, and doesn't even list the IT8686 as one of their chips.
Other "supported" chips don't appear to have any documentation easily
available, other than a very generic-y description of the chip.  Quite
an uphill battle for marginal gain.

Is it possible there's a way to access the sensors by using the EC as
a proxy, rather than trying to gain direct and exclusive access to the
sensors?  Just a thought.  I have no idea of the architecture of these
things.  Your mention of EC was the first I had heard of it :/

Thanks,

- Corey
