I'm not exactly complaining, I'm proposing a solution: at probe time, populate
prev_value members with MSR values instead of zeros. That way, the module will
correctly count energy over the time it's been loaded. It can be unloaded and
reloaded freely, and doing so would allow to easily measure energy across large
spans of time, which sounds like an improvement.

I can try to cook a corresponding patch if that sounds alright.

Cheers.
