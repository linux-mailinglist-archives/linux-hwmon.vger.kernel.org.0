The 3 energy counter MSRs are added newly in family 17h, and this
driver supports family 17h and later.

Sure, i can updated the k10temp driver once a documented way of power
reporting is available. For now, i will implement a kernel thread to reduce
the wrap around and update the documentation.

This driver is needed for servers based on Naples and Rome
which runs on Linux. The energy MSRs are accumulating registers
updated every 1ms. At present, this is a reliable and documented
way to measure power consumption over a period. Also, there
is no documented way to report power readings at this point.
