I don't recall the specifics very well, sorry in advance. :/

I vaguely remember that the adt7470 temperature inputs were connected to
the CPU, and the PWM outputs were connected to the CPU heatsink fans.
The BIOS appeared to set up the adt7470 for automatic thermal management
(i.e. when you cranked all four cores of the machine to maximum) it
would gradually raise the CPU fan speed, like you'd expect.

The reality (again, vaguely remembered) was that the chip wouldn't run
its pwm control loop unless *something* poked it to reread the
temperature sensors.  A different model of the same machine had a BMC
which would talk to the adt7470 over i2c and take care of that.

The other problem was that /some/ of the machines for whatever reason
would adjust the pwm value that you could read out over i2c, but
wouldn't actually change the fan speed unless you whacked the adt into
manual modem.

Neither of those two behaviors were listed in the datasheet, and we
(IBM) could never get an answer out of either Analog or our own hardware
group about whether or not this was the expected behavior.  I
disassembled the BMC code to figure out what the other model computer
was doing, and (clumsily) wrote that into the driver.  For all I know we
got a bad batch of adt7470s and all these weird gymnastics aren't
supposed to be necessary.

The next generation switched to a totally different chip and supplier,
so I surmise they weren't happy with the results either.  Those machines
tended to overheat if you were in Windows.

Urrk, what a doof who wrote that.  /me smacks 2009-era djwong. :P

kthread_stop blocks until the thread exits... but strangely we don't
even try to interrupt the msleep_interruptible call.  That's fine,
though device removal will take longer than it needs to.  We also don't
care about the return value of msleep_interruptible at all since one
cannot interrupt the kthread.

I probably picked interruptible sleep to avoid triggering the hangcheck
timer.

Yes, the driver should only start the kthread loop if someone wants
automatic temp control.

IIRC my experiences with that chip were that the one I was using didn't
conform to the datasheet, i.e. the automatic temp management bit /was/
set by the BIOS, but the chip didn't do adjust the pwm control until
something came along and poked the adt7470 to re-query the temperature
sensors.  Unfortunately it was being used to control the CPU fan on a
socket 771 Xeon, which meant that we really /did/ need it to cycle up
the fans when the CPU went to full load.

Needless to say I don't have that Xeon 5080 system anymore. :/
