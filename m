Well it's still in use and apparently at least one user cares enough to
report a bug and propose a candidate fix.

Thanks for both of you for your answers.

Darrick, I have 3 more questions for you if you remember...

3* I understand that the temperatures need to be read periodically in
order for automatic fan speed control to work. What I do not understand
is why you bother switching PWM outputs to manual mode each time? What
bad would happen if we did not do that? I see nothing in the datasheet
justifying it.

4* Why are you calling msleep_interruptible() in
adt7470_read_temperatures() to wait for the temperature conversions? We
return -EAGAIN if that happens, but then ignore that error code, and we
log a cryptic error message. Do I understand correctly that the only
case where this should happen is when the user unloads the kernel
driver, in which case we do not care about having been interrupted? I
can't actually get the error message to be logged when rmmod'ing the
module so I don't know what it would take to trigger it.

5* Is there any reason why the update thread is being started
unconditionally? As I understand it, it is only needed if at least one
PWM output is configured in automatic mode, which (I think) is not the
default. It is odd that the bug reporter hits a problem with the
polling thread when they are not using automatic fan speed control in
the first place so they do not need the polling thread to run. I was
wondering if it would be possible to start and stop the polling thread
depending on whether automatic PWM is enabled or not.

Thanks again,
