In case you are running a Debian-based distribution, please note that Debi=
an unconditionally executes sensors on startup, something
i discovered when the dell-smm-hwmon driver was causing issues on my machi=
ne.

So you may need to temporarily disable lm-sensors.service and/or /etc/init=
.d/lm-sensors for testing.
