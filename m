I did try the solution used for the TI chip by using i2cset to write VOUT_M=
ODE
before binding the driver, but the command only returns "Error: Write faile=
d"
for this address. I guess this chip is relative mode only.

This is the only relative mode chip I have come across.

Thanks for looking into this!
