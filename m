The chips sits behind the GPU now. But I made a blurry photo before
I added the GPU though :-). The IC's label shows "Nuvoton NCT6796D-S"
<https://gist.github.com/chunkeey/89aeb85d6f71e7a2da9344615303c203>
(the chip is soldered at an 45° angle, hence I rotated the picture)

I got that MB because of the phoronix review:
<https://www.phoronix.com/review/asrock-x670e-pg>
(NB: The review also noted the missing sensor support...
But not for much longer ;-) )

Michael Larabel also made (better) pictures:
<https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=asrock-x670e-pg&image=asrock_x670pglightning_3_lrg>

(While not the same motherboard, this Japanese review site has a
really sharp picture from the ASRock X670E Taichi NCT6796D-S SuperIO
<https://www.gdm.or.jp/x670etaichi_57_1024x768>)

That all being said: Other users in the github thread for the
lm-sensors project:
<https://github.com/lm-sensors/lm-sensors/issues/416#issuecomment-1276620580>
clearly stated that their ASUS X670E TUF came with a "NCT6799D-R".

Obviously, I'm totally fine with what the module calls it:
"NCT6799D or compatible".

There are six 4-pin fan ports on the motherboard (the list above has fan7
but not fan6. So there are still in total: six fans).

Three fans (well - one AIO with a pump and two extra fans) are permanently installed
into the case. But I have connected an old, external CPU-Fan just to check the function
of fan2,fan5 and fan7 tachometers. So this worked :).

Do you have the datasheet? I'm looking for it (I've also asked Nuvoton).
But so far no response. If you need a register range dump,
please let me know.

(AFAIK, all AMD5 X670E broads have dual chipset "chips". I think CPUTIN is
one of the two "PROM21" chips. Don't know what AUXTIN0 is...)

yes, I too think these are not connected. The values don't move, even after
a prolonged stresstest. Furthermore, neither the UEFI BIOS nor the Windows
utility has additional temperature gauges.
