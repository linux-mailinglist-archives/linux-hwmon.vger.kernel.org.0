superiotool only reports about chips it knows about. You might want to try
sensors-detect; it will at least tell you about unknown chips.

You'll probably see a note about an ACPI resource conflict. If the board
with NCT6796D wasn't yours, that may not be the case.

The register addresses for temperature limit information (if available) have
not been published by AMD for Ryzen CPUs. The same is true for other chip
specific information (voltages and power); my understanding is that AMD makes
that information only available under NDA, which is not suitable for a Linux
driver. Please feel free to contact AMD and convince them to publish the
necessary information.

This is very much _not_ k10temp. As the name says, it is the atk0110 ACPI driver
for ASUS boards. Support is very much board specific, and typically depends on
someone disassembling and analyzing the DSDT of a given board.
