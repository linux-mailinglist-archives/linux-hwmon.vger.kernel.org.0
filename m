They would be able to test the rest of the driver still. Plus I have a
register dump which I am feeding i2c-stub with, and that lets me test
the driver to some extent. God bless Mark M. Hoffman!

What I can't test are timing issues, and hardware misbehavior as
described by Darrick.

I tested and it doesn't seem so. I expected rmmod to call
adt7470_remove(), in turn calling kthread_stop() and I thought this
would interrupt the thread. But the interrupt message never gets logged.

"modprobe adt7470 && rmmod adt7470" takes 2 seconds, so I assume that
rmmod gives the thread all the time it wants to exit on its own
(through kthread_should_stop()).

Interrupt how? I tried Ctrl+C while "sensors" is waiting for the driver
to update the values, but it waits for completion before actually
exiting.

So far I couldn't find any way to get this msleep_interruptible() to
actually get interrupted.

But that at least makes some sense due to the external nature of the
thermal sensors. The data needs to be fetched from the slaves somehow
before you can read it from the ADT7470's registers.

On the other hand, having to change PWM configuration registers for
temperature readings to be correct (/if/ that's what is happening
here... not sure) is highly unexpected.

Well there's clearly a huge design mistake for that chip, sharing a
pin between FULL_SPEED and TMP_START makes it pretty much impossible
for automatic temperature monitoring to be implemented without a
software loop. And a hardware monitor device that can't run on its own
is just asking for trouble. Oh well.
