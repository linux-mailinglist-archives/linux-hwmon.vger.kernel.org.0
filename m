not sure if this is of note,

 superiotool --dump
  superiotool r
  No Super I/O found

I've contacted Asus tech re: BIOS 'gotchas' that might be interfering; I'll pass on your comments.  So far, on other issues, they've been very cooperative/helpful; we'll see how this goes.

As for the kernel log, anything specific to look for, share here?  Or just grab & post the whole thing somewhere?

Not entirely sure on the 'should' of it ... yet.

I _can_ say that, currently, for the 'new' setup, the limited info with 'k10temp' is

(1) ASUSTeK PRIME X570-PRO mobo + Ryzen7 3700X

	sensors
		k10temp-pci-00c3
		Adapter: PCI adapter
		Tdie:         +59.9°C  (high = +70.0°C)
		Tctl:         +59.9°C


and for an older board/cpu, also with 'k10temp', it's

(2) Asus M3A78-CM with a non-Ryzen, AMD Phenom II

	sensors
		k10temp-pci-00c3
		Adapter: PCI adapter
		temp1:        +42.9°C  (high = +70.0°C)
