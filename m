I have asked a colleague in the hardware team to unsolder a few of them from dismissed boards since they are hard to find due to the component shortage. I will ask you a delivery address using my personal email with a proper GPG key when I will be in possession of the chips. Would that be OK to you?

Sounds good.

Sure, will do.
