Did I say RPM anywhere for this option?

It is the index of the array that is meaningful to anything outside of 
the driver. The values are opaque. They are duty cycle in some cases 
and RPMs in other cases. The thermal subsystem knows nothing about PWM 
duty cycle nor RPMs. 

Defining a default-cooling-level would be useful to anyone, not just 
your usecase.

IOW, you are proposing:

default-pwm = <123>;

I'm proposing doing this instead:

cooling-levels = <0 123 255>;
default-cooling-level = <1>;

Every fan has at least a maximum RPM spec'ed. Probably a minium too. 
For anything in between, you're correct that you don't know. I guess you 
just assume a linear response.

I'm talking about the duty cycle needed to start the fan spinning and to 
keep it spinning. I'm sure that value is not 1 for any fan except one in 
a physics textbook (the only place friction does not exist).

Maybe the minimum is index 0 of cooling-levels?

I understand what you want. I'm trying to think ahead about what's the 
next thing someone will want to add to the binding. Just adding 1 
property at a time does not result in the best binding design. There's 
plenty of examples of that. Second, we have these fan bindings like 
pwm-fan which predate coming up with a common binding. Any further 
evolution of these bindings should not further diverge from the 
common binding. 

If your process do this once for a given platform, then having this in 
DT is fine. If the process is every user of the platform does this, then 
I don't think it should be in DT. Having users tweak the DT is not a 
great experience compared to just putting the setting in a file on 
the rootfs.

Nothing. Those should probably be moved.

Really, pwm-fan.yaml should reference fan-common.yaml and drop all the 
duplicate properties.
