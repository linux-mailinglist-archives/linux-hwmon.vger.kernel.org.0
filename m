>=20

Yeah, maybe I'm also failing in giving you all the "context". The device ha=
s kind of
three registers for failures/status/logs:

1. The ADC_ALERT_LOG. This is the typical one for violated min/max limits. =
They don't
auto-reset so I'm already doing that in the driver (after reading the alarm=
 bit).

2. The STATUS register. In this one, we have the fet bad/short failures and=
 critical
limits for VDD (under/over voltage detection). We also have overcurrent det=
ection and
the power1_good stuff we already talked about. This is one auto clears and =
it's RO.
So we kind of have a mix of faults and critical limits in here.

3. The FAULT_LOG register. This one is more about logging and is very simil=
ar (if not
identical) in the reported bits with the STATUS register. The differences i=
s that
this one does not auto-clears as it's about logging so we want to know abou=
t historic
failures and in some configurations (as mentioned before) we do need to cle=
ar the
fault log bit so the chip will be able to enable again the output voltage. =
And
regarding that we have these main bits:

 * Under voltage on VDD
 * Over voltage on VDD
 * Over current on the sense resistor
 * FET bad
 * FET short=20
 * Power bad

I can say that the under/over voltage and current will prevent the output t=
o be
enabled. I could force that state in my test environment and could see that
happening. For the FET faults I'm not sure as I cannot force those faults. =
The power
stuff won't affect the output.

>=20

Well, I'm already supporting _reset_history in the voltage/power/current ch=
annels so
I can easily extend that for clearing fault history if that is fine with yo=
u. I just
need to document it because it's a bit of an "hidden" thing. The question w=
ould also
be, should I just document this for this chip docs or in the general hwmon =
docs?
