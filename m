I see, thank you for the clarification.

I agree that it would be better, I tried this approach because the Control =
Center software provided for Microsoft Windows uses direct port i/o, so I d=
idn't really put much thought into the possible existence of an ACPI method=
 to get the data, I am not familiar with ACPI either.

I did, at least I tried to examine the DSDT, but I could not really find an=
ything fan related. Now I looked again, same results. Maybe it's that I don=
't know what exactly I should be looking for. And I feel like the acpi/fan =
driver should have picked it up, no? I could identify the EC, however. But =
I don't see anything relevant there, either. That's not to say there isn't,=
 I just couldn't find it.
