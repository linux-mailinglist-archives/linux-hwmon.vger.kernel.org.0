I'm not touching that. If always-on is set DT, REGULATOR_CHANGE_STATUS
won't be set. What I'm proposing does not change that.

That's very much different from what we initially discussed. It can
certainly be done, what is proposed here already does 90% of the job in
that direction. However, I'm not sure that is what people intended when
they did not put anything. A chip that was previously locked, would be
unlocked following such change. It's an important behaviour change.

That's not what the regulator framework does. At the moment, it is DT
and nothing else. After the linked change, it would be DT if no
init_data is passed - otherwise, the init_data.

If a something in between, whichever the one you want to give priority
to, that will have to re-implemented on the caller side.
This is what I meant by redo the parsing on pmbus side.

It goes way beyond what I'm proposing.
The only thing done here is something you simply cannot put in DT
because DT is static. Following init, if the chip write protected,
REGULATOR_CHANGE_STATUS should not be set, regardless of what is in DT.
If it is not set, I'm not adding it.

Also, what I'm proposing does not get in the way of DT, or anything
else, providing constraints. What I propose allow to make adjustement in
the HW based on the constraint, if this is what you want to do. It also
allows to update the constaints based on what the HW actually is.
If the chip cannot be written, regulator needs to know.

I'm fine adding that. The init callback is also the place to do it.
As pointed above, this may not be what current user intended. Also,
implementing that means that, for a chip with multiple pmbus regulators,
a single always-on missing will unlock the chip. Also pmbus will need to
adjusted so the hwmon attributes are registered after the regulators, to
get the permission right.

> We should not try to override devicetree constraints.

I don't think I am. I'm just reading the chip state and adjusting the
constraint. Even after implementing what is suggested above, it will
still be necessary to readback and adjust the constraint based the
read protection. Unlock is not guranteed to succeed, the chip may be
permanently lock. Some provide the option to do that.

The type regulator being registered is not known at this point, unless
you to use something as weak as comparing the ops pointer to
pmbus_ops. Without that, I don't really seee how you safely manipulate
the constraints. If it is not the generic pmbus regulator, the
constraints should not be touched by pmbus_core.

There is an infinity of ways to merge the constraints between what
regulator_register() gets and what the framework will parse DT. It is
impossible to get right on the regulator side. Regulator is just picking
one and that's it (always DT at the moment). That's the only sane thing
the regulator framework can do IMO.

If you want a merge between runtime based constraints, such as write
protect, and possibly DT - all that ready before regulator registration
in init_data, then yes, a lot of the DT parsing will have to redone in
PMBus before regulator_register is called. It is also something that
will have to be done only for regulator using the pmbus_ops(). I don't
really see how to make that happen in pmbus_regulator_register() without
some sort of callback.
