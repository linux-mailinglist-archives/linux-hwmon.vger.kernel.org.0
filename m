It doesn't matter, the GPIO (not _raw) APIs are using logical levels, 1 — activate,
0 — deactivate.

Yes, but why do you have that flag in the structure?

	*val = DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST_ULL(be16_to_cpu(in) * (u64)fs + (BIT(16) - 1), BIT(16));

will give the same result without division, no?
What you need is to make sure that the multiplication won't get closer to
U64_MAX, which seems not the case here (max 48-bit number).

Ditto for all other similar cases which I already pointed out.

I'm not sure I got this. The << 16 neither a plain number and BIT() is equally
good. With power of two it's most likely that this is due to internal
implementation of the firmware or hardware, so again BIT() can be still good
enough to show that.

Please do.
