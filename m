We appreciate the prompt response!

That is a fair point.

What about enabling this during runtime in case user will want to 
utilize this?

e.g. ioctl/sysfs/debugfs

Of course users can configure the interval during runtime (or even 
devfreq based?).


The only concern we had for doing it from usrespace is the short 
interval (and multiple sensors) required will create overhead. Of course 
doing that in kernel space doesn't make this overhead go away and even 
worsen it as we don't go via scheduler. (but does ease 
userspace/kernelspace context switch).

And of course the added value of contributing such a feature which does 
make sense as probably many want to know across their HW what is the 
power consumption. are you aware of some package that supply this kind 
of info? or everyone interested is doing some sort of home made solution?
