Dearest,

Good day and how are you doing today. I'm really delighted to
communicate with you and I believe we can achieve everything together
and create something great in nearest future. My name is Ms. Vina
Omran Hussain Ibrahim and I'm a young girl of 24 year old from Kobani
a city in the Aleppo Governorate in Northern Syria and presently, I'm
residing in the Republic of Burkina Faso as a refugee due to killing
of my parents by the ISIS fighters on the year 2015 popularly know as
"Kobani Massacre" that was carried out by the Daesh/ISIS fighters.
Please don't be discouraged for hearing this. I believe deep down
inside me that you will never break my heart or let me down in anyway.

My beloved father(Mr.Omran Hussain Ibrahim ) was the Mayor of the city
of Kobani and also the Head of Aleppo Investment Authority. The brutal
killing of my father took place one early morning by the Daesh/ISIS
fighters as a result of the ongoing civil war in Syria. I was in my
first year in the University of Aleppo studying Arts and Humanities
before the sad incident and that led to the death of my beloved
father. Darling, I know that it is too early to disclose my life story
to you but please bear with me. My living condition is very critical,
please I need your possible help to reclaim my inheritance and start a
new life. My uncle have sought to kill me so that he will have full
control of my father's estate but I am happy that all his evil failed.

Meanwhile, I decided to travel abroad in order to secure my future but
the problem is that since I don't have an international passport, I
cannot be allowed to enter any Country freely and legally. However,
the only choice for me was to enter Turkey, because it is not far from
Kobani and many people are crossing to Turkey so I joined them and
crossed over to Turkey. It was in my presence that the Turkish
soldiers gunned down Kader Ortakaya a famous woman activist at the
Turkey and Syria border. A lot happened during this conflict, it was
awful, I only thank God that I'm alive today.

I arrived to Burkina Faso through the help of International Red Cross
and Red Crescent Movement, they were moving people away from the
Turkish border because of the insecurity of the border, so they moved
some people to Canada, some to Germany and Italy and few to Morocco
and Burkina Faso. I decided to come to Burkina Faso, because when my
beloved father was alive, he revealed to me about the sum of $27.5
Million which he deposited in one of the Banks in Burkina Faso with my
name as his next of kin. On my arrival to Ouagadougou, where the Bank
is located, I contacted them to clear the money, but the Branch
operation Manager who confirmed the deposited amount of money told me
that my status as a refugee according to the Laws of Burkina Faso does
not permit me to engage in any Bank transaction. He advised me to
nominate a trustee who will stand on my behalf and carry out the
operation. This has become necessary after I have been denied the
right to own a Bank account or perform other forms of financial
transaction here because I am a political asylum seeker. So, I decided
to get in touch with you so that you will help me with the transfer of
this money into your Bank account for investment in your Country.
After you have received the money in your Bank account, you will send
me some amount of money to process my traveling papers because I want
to relocate to your Country where I will start a new life with you.
And I intend to complete my academic studies in your Country. I accept
to share my life with you and give you all my attention from day one
of the meetings.

Immediately you confirm your interest to help me, then I will give you
more details as to how we shall conclude this transaction. Please do
let me know if you are interested in helping me with the transfer of
the money into your bank account for possible investment in your
Country so that I will send you more details on how you will stand as
my trustee and finalize the transaction with the Bank where my dad
deposited the money. I beg you please to keep this as a top secret
between us for confidential reasons. At the moment I am living in the
Mission House. Life in this place is very unbearable because we are
not allowed to go out and we are monitored by the Church security
guard. Please help me because I want to leave this place quickly to
live my normal with you.Please all communications should be through
this email address for confidential purposes ( miss.vina24@gmail.com
).

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours truly
Ms.Vina Omran Hussain Ibrahim .
