That kind of contradicts what you say above, that patch 5 won't be
needed anymore. Am I missing something ?

Not really sure myself. At he very least we'll have sysfs properties,
so the minimum speed could also be updated from userspace. Ultimately
we'll need some set of devicetree properties, not only for fans but
for pretty much everything supported by hwmon, but I have no idea what
is acceptable and what isn't - if I did I might have proposed something
by now.
