Only Dell hardware has this "implicit" dependency that requires IPMI
opregion to be functional.

Sure, will do.

Because acpi_power_meter's ACPI method access IPMI opregion, which
requires the driver to install the opregion handler and wait for SMI
being selected.

AFAIK there's no mean to discover the "dependency" here, hence the hack...
