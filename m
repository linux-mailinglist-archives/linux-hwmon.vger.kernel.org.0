I've looked through corsair-psu sources, and I think filtering in
raw_event won't be enough.

For example, in corsairpsu_request, there are 2 commands, and they
should be executed consecutively:
1) corsairpsu_usb_cmd(priv, 2, PSU_CMD_SELECT_RAIL, rail, NULL);
2) corsairpsu_usb_cmd(priv, 3, cmd, 0, data);

If the userspace will squeeze another PSU_CMD_SELECT_RAIL between (1)
and (2), the driver will get data for a wrong rail (and with the
current code won't even notice it).

So unless there is a way to "lock" hidraw (and it seems that there
isn't - looking at the code, hidraw calls the low-level hid driver
directly, as far as I understand), it won't work correctly.

And if a driver can't work correctly with hidraw enabled - maybe it
shouldn't enable hidraw? So that the user can 1) notice that something
is wrong 2) blacklist or unbind the driver (or userspace tools that
use hidraw can unbind automatically). Otherwise everything seems to be
silently broken.

On the other hand, maybe races between the kernel driver and userspace
tools are unlikely, because the driver doesn't talk to the device
continuously - only when sysfs reads happen.
