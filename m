And I feel like the acpi/fan driver should have picked it up, no? I could identify the EC, however. But I don't see anything relevant there, either. That's not to say there isn't, I just couldn't find it.

that is exactly what it is supposed to be used for, and Microsoft was
involved in writing its specification. Oh well, it is what it is.
