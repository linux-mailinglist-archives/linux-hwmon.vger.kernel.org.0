Yeah, sorry - I was kinda making a general point there about not liking
having integer values mapped to some sort of meaning, when units or some
other sort of more meaningful property is possible.
I really do not like these sorts of properties that you go and put
"gpio-mode =3D <3>;" or whatever in the devicetree.
I know its not quite units, but you could use 5, 10 & 15 as the
allowable values for the divider property and I think that'd be fine.

Oh and now that I think of it - for the divider property, how does
"adi,undervoltage-dividers =3D 0" differ from omitting the property
altogether? It's not entirely apparently from the binding what that
actually means. If they do differ, I think you need to mention what
the omission of the property means, and if they do not, then that =3D 0
case should be removed IMO.

Yeah, with one hat on, sure, I don't care. Realistically I am aware that
having these integers makes your life a little easier though.

=46rom me at least, I try to push people away from these sorts of integer
properties and will continue to do so.

Cheers,
