I think this is no BIOS bug, but valid behavior since the Windows ACPI-WMI=
 mapper
converts the ACPI objects into a common buffer format as described here:

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/driver-d=
efined-wmi-data-items

I assume that the mapper converts the ACPI string into a WMI string buffer=
, and that
a common ACPI buffer is just passed as-is. In this case, the error lies in=
side the
linux WMI subsystem, which does not do such a conversion.

I can try to find out more about this conversion and its rules, and use th=
is to add
support for that to the WMI subsystem. This would prevent such errors in t=
he future
and would bring us closer to full ACPI WMI support inside the kernel.

This will take quite some time however, so i would suggest adding a quirk =
handler
first and replace this with the WMI conversion functions later.
