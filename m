Hi Guenter,

While investigating this issue, I previously mentioned
about a flow where SPD write disabled state can be
exported as a capability from the i801 controller, so
that the SPD5118 hwmon driver consumes it.

The SPD write disabled state is known to the controller
driver (i2c-i801), but this information is not
propagated to client drivers. As a result, auto-detected
devices may be instantiated and probed even though the
controller cannot support the required access model.

This raises a major architectural question:

Should SMBus / I2C controller drivers be able to
advertise bus-level capability constraints (such as SPD
write disabled state) to client drivers, so that clients can
make an informed decision during probe?

A capability-based approach would allow:
* controller drivers to expose what is possible on a given bus
* client drivers to decide whether they can operate correctly
* avoidance of device-specific policy in controller drivers
* consistent handling across different SPD-capable devices

I actually tested the possibility of detecting, propagating,
and consuming the SPD write disabled state using an I2C
adapter capability flag. Using this approach, I was able to
fix the issue even with the CONFIG_SENSORS_SPD5118_DETECT
kernel configuration enabled.

At this stage, I am not proposing a specific implementation.
The goal of this RFC is to get agreement on whether this type
of problem should be solved through capability propagation,
and if so, what mechanism would be preferred.

Any feedback on design direction, or existing infrastructure
that could be reused would be very welcome.
