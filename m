Ah, that makes sense now.  So I guess what's worse is that now you
have a combination of two chips, which are not necessarily always
paired with each other (e.g. IT8792->IT8686 vs. IT8795 [made up
#]->IT8686). I give up :)

At least the out-of-tree driver source has been working nicely for my
machine for a couple of weeks, with no observed glitches, resets, etc.
I'm happy.

Thanks for the discussion of this little backwater area of the kernel :)
