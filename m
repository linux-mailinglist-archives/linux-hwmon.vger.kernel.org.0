I would assume that either that rail is not used in that board design 
and was disabled in the non-volatile config on the chip, or alternately 
the chip allows combining outputs C and D (i.e. 3 and 4) into a single 
output in which case only one will report valid data. Not sure offhand 
if there is a way to detect those cases from the PMBus interface at 
probe time.
