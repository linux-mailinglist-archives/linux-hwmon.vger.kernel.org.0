Dear friend,

Can you join me and help people?

It's my pleasure to have contact with you, based on the critical
condition I find myself and my desire to will part of my property to
the Orphans, Disable, blind, Old and poor people who have nothing to
eat, although, it's not financial problem I have but my health, you
might have know that cancer is not what to talk  about at home I have
been in the hospital for 5 months now I am Mrs Rose Banneth and I am
married to Mr. Abaulkarim banneth who worked with Tunisia embassy in
Burkina Faso for nine years before he died in the year 2008.We were
married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief
illness that lasted for five days.

Since his death I decided not to remarry. When my late husband was
alive he deposited the sum of US$ 8.2million  (Eight million two
hundred thousand dollars)  in a bank in Burkina Faso for me, Presently
this money is still in bank. I want you to help me use this money for
the poor people around you in your Country it is the Almighty God
direction that I choose you to do this with your heart.

My Doctors told me that I don't have much time to live because of the
cancer problem and i don t want to live this money in the bank for
Government instead I decided to use it for Old people who cannot work
again and Orphans who have nothing to eat because i am Orphan, Having
known my condition I decided to hand over this fund to a responsible
person that have fear of God to receive this money and use  it for the
needy instead of this money be forgotten to the bank. Can you have the
time to do this? If so please, i want you to contact me here my
private email address mrsrosebanneth9@gmail.com

I wait for your response.
My regards,
Mrs Rose Banneth
