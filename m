Correct, no tacho.

I am not sure I what you mean with the RPM reference here? The 
cooling-levels support in the fan-pwm.c driver is a mapping between 
cooling levels and PWM values, NOT RPM value.

Where should these "invented" RPM values come from when there is no 
tacho signal? That sounds backwards / complicated for the very trivial 
"what should the default PWM value be at driver probe time" use case.

The minimum PWM is presumably 0, E.G. signal always low?

The use case (as described in the commit message) is to drive the fan 
less hard to limit noise and/or power consumption. The input to the fan 
drive control is a PWM setting, so it IMHO makes sense to specify that, 
as that is the interface provided by the fan-pwm driver - E.G. you boot 
up and tweak the pwm1 property in sysfs until you have a value that 
suits the noise/power consumption requirements and stick that value in 
the dts.

What makes this "default-pwm" (or whatever it will be called) more 
generic than E.G. the recently added "fan-stop-to-start-percent" / 
"fan-stop-to-start-usec" properties added to pwm-fan.yaml by commit 
80bc64201e78 ("dt-bindings: hwmon: pwm-fan: Document start from stopped 
state properties")?
