Quite obviously it _is_ known that this board only has a single chip,
and it will never magically have a second chip.

Chip specific code should be implemented in the probe function (which
is chip specific), not in the init function (which isn't).

It doesn't need to do anything but set values or parameters. Any action
should be done in the probe function, not in the init function.
