Nuvoton was nice enough to send me one, after telling them that I am
the hardware monitoring maintainer and that I keep getting asked to
add Linux support for this chip. 

I'll have to spend some time tracking down the hysteresis issue.
I think there may be a bug in the code. Temperature registers have
changed in NCT6798 and NCT6799. I only have systems with NCT6797,
but it seems wrong there as well. I'll need to do some debugging.

Ok, good to know.
