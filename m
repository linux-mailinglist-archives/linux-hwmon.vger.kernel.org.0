I'm very skeptical all these documentation changes relate to a same=20
logical change. I didn't even try to read it but on a glance some look=20
purely editorial so this should be split properly as well.

Please don't do any unrelated changes (such as formatting changes) in the=
=20
same patch. Each logical change should be in own patch and properly=20
justified in the changelog.

Here you're changing the formatting to something much messier.

Always add comma to non-terminating entries.

Are .fan_count and number of elements in .paths actually related because=20
I think you just added one extra entry (I'm not familiar enough with this=
=20
driver to tell if that is a problem or not)?

Since this change is already big and messy, I suggest you make a separate=

E.g. SLOPE_CALC doesn't appear in your patch more than once, nor in the=20
mainlike kernel. Please don't add useless/cryptic comments like this.

> +=09limit =3D ((long)data->internal_max_slew_rpm_s * (long)dt_ms) / 1000;

1000 should likely be converted to something in units.h

Shouldn't this use proper 64-bit divide interface? (A pre-existing=20
problem.)

These match changes are not justified by the changelog at all.

Moving stuff around in a feature change?

Please split this into series of patches, each patch properly justified=20
and doing one logical thing.

Eh, you removed the 1000 define for TAU_MS and now you add it back as=20
literal. Please try to avoid avoid adding literals.

I don't think that comment adds value and is overly verbose as well.

Literal 1 should use a named define.

e_max_rpm);

The general convention is that probe should mostly be quiet when it=20
succeeds.

An unrelated change.

The old way was way better. And this too looks entirely unrelated change.


This was extremely messy to review. Please only resubmit after splitting=20
this into a series which does only a single logical change per patch.

And right before doing the next submission, my suggestion is: please try=20
to review it yourself. If, while reviewing it yourself, you don't=20
understand something or feel need to skip reading some lines because the=20
change is so big or get messy, it will likely cause the same feeling for=20
the other reviewers as well and you should rethink the approach and ensure=
=20
you've really split it into manageable (reviewable) chunks.
