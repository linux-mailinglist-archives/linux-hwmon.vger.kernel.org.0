This series adds some new features to the axi-fan-control driver. On top
of that, the HW had some changes (basically it now starts automatically
out of reset) so that the driver needed some minor refactoring. The
reason I'm sending this as RFC, is mainly because of the last patch
("hwmon: axi-fan-control: support temperature vs pwm points"). The core
has some predefined values which define a temperature vs pwm curve [1].
It also exposes registers so that users can change it according to their
needs. As I could not find standard attributes in the subsystem, I'm
proposing some "raw" sysfs files. Looking at [2], the pwm_auto_point
stuff looked to be what I want. Obviously I might be wrong :). If this
is accepted, I will add a proper sysfs DOC file describing the new files
(being lazy in the RFC).

For patch 5 ("hwmon: axi-fan-control: clear the fan fault irq at startup"),
it's also arguable if we really need it. The main reason I have it is
because of some userland apps that might take some drastic measures by
just reading 1 fan_fault alarm. Obviously, we can argue that the problem
is in the app and not in the driver. Though it's such a minimal change
that I decided to include it (I'm more than fine in dropping the patch).
