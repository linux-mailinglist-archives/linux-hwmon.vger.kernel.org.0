generic if the units are generic. Though if the register value is
opaque to s/w, then maybe register value is fine.

A range, but the register value can only be 0 or 1?

I think the function should be within the node. Otherwise, the
addressing becomes weird (e.g. input@3 is under current-sensors or
something) with seemingly separate address spaces.

'type' is a bit generic. We don't want the same property name to
possibly have multiple definitions.

If it is how you address an instance of something which seems to be
the case here, then 'reg' should be used.
