I will take a look at in0_min_alarm. Thank you for your advice.

You are right, this test would drain the battery too faster if done too
often. This is why the test is limited to every 5 seconds and this is
agreed with the electronics engineers. I will document that fact too.

That's possible for some designs yes. I will discuss that with the
electronics engineer for future designs with separate RTC chip.

Thank you for your feedback!
