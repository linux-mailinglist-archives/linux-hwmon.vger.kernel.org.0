Yeah, I can also just come up with a minimal test driver and devicetree.

This is where I lost you :(. So, I'm might be overcomplicating things but..=
. Again,
the case where someone wired up HW so that we can actually use the pin to d=
rive the
line high (having an external pull up). In that case, If I return error, th=
en I won't
be able to effectively set the line high (as you said, set_value will not b=
e called
on it either).

Now, I do understand that if we have the line flagged as GPIO_OPEN_DRAIN, t=
hen
gpiolib will switch the line to input which means we will set the line in h=
igh-z
which means that if we have a pull up, then the line will be high. I mean, =
it works
but it would be strange if someone wants to have the line as output high an=
d after
trying to set the it high, it sees the pin moving to input.=C2=A0But if thi=
s is how it
should be, fine by me.

I do understand this is the definition of open drain so I guess someone sho=
uld know
what to expect when operating with pins like this.

>=20

Yes, that is the only thing we have. Meaning that there is no hw setting to=
 set the
pins to open drain. Open drain is what they are. That is why I'm not seeing=
 the point
in having PIN_CONFIG_DRIVE_OPEN_DRAIN implemented.

Anyways, I'll try to have something cooked next week. I'll be slow since th=
e winter
(not even there yet) in Germany already got me!
