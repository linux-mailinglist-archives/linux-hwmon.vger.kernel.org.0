Fair enough, we can just log the warning for now.

Sure, but not doing anything will just make the bug carry on for ever in
the firmware. SO logging warning is minimum we should do IMO.

Fair enough.

Anyways, better to check that for current and future platforms if not the
legacy ones.

Ah, that's just inconsistency I believe. I will raise a defect.

I don't think what Linux drivers should be the reference as there are other
OSVs.

Not sure if I follow that. The way I expect is platform won't populate the
signature if everything is not initialised and running at it's end which
implies it is not ready to accept the request.
