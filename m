It's been a while since the k10temp documentation has been updated.
There are new CPU families supported as well as Tdie temp was added.
This patch adds all missing families which I was able to find from git
history and provides more info about Tctl vs Tdie exported temps.

 If the BIOS has enabled hardware temperature control, the threshold at

+On some AMD CPUs, there is a difference between the die temperature (Tdie) and
+the reported temperature (Tctl). Tdie is the real measured temperature, and
+Tctl is used for fan control. While Tctl is always available as temp1_input,
