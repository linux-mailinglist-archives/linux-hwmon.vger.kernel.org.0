I poked through the platform/device/bus interfaces but couldn't work out how to create the device but not probe it, so that userspace could later bind the device to the driver. The current userspace does just that, but it relies on the the initial probe failing since SBE can't handle the communications yet. The error scenario is that the SBE can get into a bad state, so communications shouldn't even be attempted.

What a mess.

The subject and description are misleading. The code doesn't
"avoid polling during probe", it delays hwmon registration until
directed to do it by writing into a new sysfs attribute.
Please update accordingly.
