They are unrelated, period. You only consider systems where a resource
conflict exists. Also, you could (try to) use acpi_enforce_resources=lax
instead.

Everything else is just a coincidence that applies to _your_ system.

That isn't the point here. The problem is not with the patches, it is with
the rationale for the patches.

If there is such an out-of-tree convention, it is wrong. The
variable is not a boolean (it sets the runtime access permissions)
and must not be initialized with one. Case in point: Using "true"
as initializer would translate to permission 0001 (S_IXOTH,
execute permission for "other") which obviously would not make
any sense.
