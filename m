Correct. We'll need a bindings document, though, to make it official.

The binding would look something like "vrm-mode = <number>", where
<number> is well defined (possibly in an include file). There are many
bindings include files which you can use as examples.
We'll need to get DT maintainer approval for the exact binding name;
maybe it has to be "pmbus,vrm-mode" or something like that.

Thanks,
