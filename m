I suppose that such boards does not have an implementation of required WMI
method or dumps that I have does not provide such methods. I have used UEFI
capsules and dumps from linux hardware database.=20
Sometime version provided on ASUS support site can't be unpacked by
uefi-firmware-parser or does not have WMI method required for sensor suppor=
t.=20
Or linux hardware database does not have dumps for such boards.=20

As result - script can't detect that such board has support of WMI method
for sure.

Currently, I have information about 19 boards based on such chipset, where
sensor region defined in unknown way or partially for two boards:
* ROG STRIX Z370-H GAMING
* ROG MAXIMUS X HERO.
Other bios dumps for boards or can't be downloaded or can't be unpacked.

So mostly its question when someone test code on a real board
or DSDT dumps will uploaded to https://github.com/linuxhw/ACPI or
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3D204807 with known region
definitions and WMI methods.
=20
Boards could have a different way of define region for sensor or a
different WMI method for access to sensor in the theory. Or a sensor could =
be
accessed without ACPI conflicts that sometime happens for different board
revision.

Look to https://github.com/asus-wmi-boards-sensors/asus-board-dsdt for more
information.

Could you please add your board dump as an issue to github or to
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3D204807 by `acpidump -b`?=20
If you can build kernel, could you please build kernel with additional "ROG
STRIX Z370-G GAMING" line to `asus_wmi_boards` list?

I hope it will help. Thank you!

Best regards,
