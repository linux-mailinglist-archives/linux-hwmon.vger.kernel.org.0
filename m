Normally (or at least so far) the device ID specifications are for a group
of models, not just for one chip in the group. Traditionally, AMD uses the
same PCI ID for model numbers 7xh, so 70h would probably be more appropriate.
Of course, that is hard to say without documentation from AMD, and I don't
see anything published for Ryzen 3000.

Wouldn't that require patches to the Super-IO chip on your board ?
That seems orthogonal to this patch series (and to the R3000 CPU).

Sorry myself, I didn't realize that the patches were from different people
since they looked similar.
