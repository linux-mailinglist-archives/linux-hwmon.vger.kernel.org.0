Looks like they've broken the SMM method for XPS 9560 too in a recent firmware upgrade.
Have you thought about the possibility to fall back to i8k_get_temp() when the label
method fails, or when the user decides to explicitly enable it as an alternative with
a module option?

Looks like Dell decided to change the API so future firmwares will stop supporting
that method anyway, so I think action must be taken in the driver to address the problem.

Kind regards,
Michele.
