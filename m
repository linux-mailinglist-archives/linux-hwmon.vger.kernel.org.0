These chips have two I2C addresses with two separate interfaces: the 
standard PMBus-compatible interface at an address between 0x40-0x4f, 
which the irps5401 driver supports, and another proprietary interface at 
an address between 0x10-0x1f. The specific addresses in those ranges is 
configured by the value of a resistor on one of the pins.

This would be my first suggestion as well.

I don't think the PMBus interface on these chips exposes any interface 
to command the regulator. However, one could do this over the Infineon 
programming/control interface on the 0x10-0x1f addresses. This protocol 
is documented publicly now (see the programming guide and register map 
document on the Infineon web site).
