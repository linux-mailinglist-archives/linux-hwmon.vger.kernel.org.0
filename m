This is detected with the FB pin and a voltage divider (from the output
voltage). Basically depending on the level of that pin, the chip indicate p=
ower
good or power bad. I was also very reluctant with this attribute (I mention=
 it
in the v1 cover). This might not even indicate any misbehave. We also suppo=

reporting this using the gpio1 pin (if we set it that way). So, I guess I c=

just drop this one and add support for it if we ever have a real usecase wh=

can actually justify having it :).

We already have the power_bad fault log in debugfs so I'm not sure if addin=
g
this one there adds much value.

fet_short - This is one is detected if the ADC measures a current sense vol=

fet_bad - Is set by monitoring the voltage at the gate and the drain to sou=

voltage.

These ones might indicate real issues with the HW so I thought they could b=

important...

It would be better than nothing. And we do have fault logs for both these
failures so userspace could also use that to know exactly what was the issu=
e. If
that's ok with you, I would then report this in inX_fault? Did you had in m=
ind
putting this in in0 (vsource) or adding a new channel?

In my first draft I had another voltage channel (label: VFET) to report the
fet_bad condition. I was using the inX_crit or inX_lcrit but it felt bad so=
 I
removed it...

Well, this one is because in some configurations the chip won't enable the
output load until you reset/clear the fault log keeping it from enabling th=
e
output.=C2=A0This is the comment I have in the code:

"Fault log failures. These faults might be important in systems where auto-=
retry
is not enabled since they will cause the part to latch off until they are
cleared. Typically that happens when the system admin is close enough so he=
 can
check what happened and manually clear the faults. Moreover, manually clear=
ing
the faults might only matter when ON_FAULT_MASK in the CONTROL register is =
set
(which is the default) as in that case, a turn off signal from the ON pin w=
on't
clear them."

In v1 I was allowing to clear fauls log individually and you recommended to=
 have
an attribute to clear them all at once as that would simplify things.=C2=A0

I just kept it in here because this might be important for the chip to work=
 as
expected again so having it in debugfs might be weird.

Thanks!
