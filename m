That I understand, and while it is poor design in my opinion, it makes
sense to some degree.

Ah. That would be the reason for the extra code. Automatic fan speed
control that needs to be refreshed manually. Oh my.

My experiments seem to confirm this.

How would we do that if we wanted to? Later you say this is not
possible?

Yes, up to 2 seconds in my tests. Not pleasant, but also not
necessarily something to worry about, as rmmod is usually not needed.

I don't understand that part. Is a 2 second uninteruptible sleep in a
kthread considered bad somehow?

OK, I'll give it a try. I don't want to add too much complexity though.
