It sounds like MFD is (once more) being used as a dumping ground for
random devices which do not fit anywhere else.  A Multi-Function Device
driver's role is to create shared resources (memory, IRQs, Clocks,
Regulators, etc) for and register more than one real device that uses
those shared resources, that's all.  Even if you were to move the Misc
part out, using that as a second device to prove it MFD-worthy is not
going to fly.  Take a look at what these devices usually consist of:

  git grep -W "struct mfd_cell.*{" -- drivers/mfd

This submission results in a 650-line driver that registers a single
cell.  One that is attributed only to the device it's being removed
from.

I see that Guenter already said:

  "This is not hardware monitoring functionality and would have to
  reside elsewhere, outside the hwmon subsystem."

Well it's not MFD functionality either.  Sorry.
