If you refer to my earlier patches, there are two problems with them.
First, they were not in a form acceptable for upstream submission
(one patch per logical change).
Second, and more severe, a lot of the code is experimental and
sometimes caused problems (restarts) on my systems. This was
especially the case if the hardware had a second device (another
it87xx or an embedded controller) accessing the chip in parallel.
I had tried some workarounds, but never really managed to stabilize
the code. While this is kind of ok for out-of-tree code, it isn't
acceptable for the upstream kernel. Getting support from ITE and/or
from a board vendor was all but impossible. ITE typically doesn't
even admit that a chip exists, and all I got from board vendors
- if anything - was "we don't support Linux". I don't know if it
is even remotely possible to fix those problems without support
from ITE and/or board vendors.
