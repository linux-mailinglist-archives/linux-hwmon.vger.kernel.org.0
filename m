Yeah, I would also like to have this in but since I'm adding the driver to =
hwmon,
I'll leave the final word to Guenter.

I did not used libgpiod but I did tested it with gpio-sysfs. Well, I could
effectively see the pull down behaviour but since my eval board has no pull=
-ups I
could not drive the line high.

Yeah, I did look at that after you pointed that out. There's just something=
 I'm still
not getting. This HW has no explicit open drain setting because open drain =
is all
that it is. So, I guess we could just specify the flag in devicetree so gpi=
olib could
use the emulation but I wonder how would we have things in case we have the=
 HW setup
to drive the pin high (so having this as GPOs)?

I see, but in this case, the pins could be outputs depending on the HW setu=
p but
there's no way for us to know that in the driver. And given the fact that (=
I think)
it's highly unlikely for pins like this to ever be GPIs and GPOs at the sam=
e time, I
brought the devicetree property to define input and output only. So, roughl=
y, what I
have in mind now for the chip is;

.set_config() -> with PULL_DOWN and HIGH_IMPEDANCE support
.direction_input() -> This is important for gpio1 where we do have an hw se=
tting to
set the direction. On the other pins I was thinking in just forcing high-z.=
 Or maybe
can I just rely on gpio_set_bias()?
.direction_ouput() -> Would only matter for gpio1
.get/set_value() -> And in this case we just assume that high value might o=
r might
not be possible (depending on the hw setup). Note that reading the pin stat=
e is
always possible.

This means that I assume we can have both directions but that is not really=
 case and
one needs to know what it is doing :). Or in cases like this, we just ignor=
e the
possibility of having GPO's and we let gpiolib do the emulation?

Sounds reasonable or not really how I should handle this open-drain only pi=
ns?

Thanks for the help!
