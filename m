You /could/ theoretically send the kthread a signal to interrupt the
sleep, though I can't remember if kthreads are sufficiently special that
signals don't work...

...but probably not necessary since nobody's complained about the 2s
yet.

Not really, but the sysadmin can (probably ill-advisedly) set the
hangcheck timer to go off after 1 second.
