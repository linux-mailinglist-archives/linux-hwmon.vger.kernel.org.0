I never noticed any issues of that kind. I actually did quite a lot of
userspace testing. A result of this a userspace tool you can find here:
https://github.com/wgottwalt/corsair-psu/tree/main/tools/rmi-hxi-query

Though, if you find a way to trigger such a race condition I have no
problem to remove the hidraw part.
