It is a difficult subject, and I am struggling myself with the situations
you are presenting.

I have seen a couple of those recently. I think returning -ENODATA
if the value isn't known (yet) is the best possible solution. I thought
about adding that to the ABI, actually.

Again, I think the best solution is to return -ENODATA until the value
is known.

I think the above should resolve that.

It is a bad idea to return 0 if the value is not accepted. You could check
if the written value matches the current value and return 0 if it does,
and an error such as -EOPNOTSUPP or -EINVAL otherwise.

Mode isn't really writeable either, isn't it ? If so, use the same trick as
with the _enable attribute.

The same is effectively true for the pwm value itself: Since both _enable
and _mode are effectively read-only, you can accept a write only if
fan control is enabled, and return an error if it isn't.

Just document the difference. Reality doesn't always match our expectations.
