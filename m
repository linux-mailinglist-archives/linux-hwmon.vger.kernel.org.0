I think 2) is the easier and less complex solution for now.

No problem. Thanks for the explanation.

I think you need to check for four values right now:

- Try to read MFR_VOUT_MIN. If that does not work, read VOUT_MARGIN_LOW.
- Same for high values.

Ultimately, yes, I think we should add a list of limits. I think it
would make more sense though to add the limits to a new regulator
specific data structure. Maybe we should create a separate data structure
for regulators. Right now we pass struct pmbus_data. Maybe we need
struct pmbus_regulator_data which would contain a pointer to
struct pmbus_data as well as additional information needed for
regulators.

Thanks,
