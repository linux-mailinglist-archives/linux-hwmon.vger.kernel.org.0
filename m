Makes sense. Thanks for giving me some historical background!

Yes, but what I meant is that I don't mind not having authorship on
these patches since most of my work will be on adding new features.
Sorry for not being clear.

I can't blame you for that! Could anyone in this thread add Vicki Pfau
to figure out what's the best course of action?

We could merge his patches (if he contacted the x86 crew), make a v2 of
mine (71h -> 70h, add his Signed-off-by?) and merge, or some other option?
