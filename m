Noted... will go with that and add an introductory patch for having inX_fau=

hwmon.

>=20

But that would be just related with the output voltage. You can also have
failures on VDD (over and undervolatge fault - I'm using in1_crit and in1_l=
crit)
and if you have the auto retry bit disabled, then clearing fault logs might=
 be
important. This attribute is nice because makes it clear what will be done.
OTOH, I do understand your worries with non standard ABI...

I'm not sure how usual is for fault logs to be around that would justify fo=
r a
global standard attribute.
