My question was more on mandating a single string instead of letting
users decide. I don't care either if it isn't used for anything in
particular, but you specifically mandate "input" as the only valid
string. I am not a DT expert, but it seems to me that mandating the
content of that string and then not using it other than to ensure that
the user really specified "input" doesn't make much sense to me.
Having said that, if this is the DT way of things, it is ok with
me.

It does open up a nother dimension for multi-type sensor chips, though,

For a chip with voltage and temperature sensors:

	temperature@0 {
		reg = <0>;
	};

	voltage@0 {
		reg = <0>;
	};

vs:

	temperature-sensors {
		xxx@0 {
			reg = <0>;
		};
	};

	voltage-sensors {
		xxx@0 {
			reg = <0>;
		};
	};

This is way out of my league in terms of what is appropriate,
except that "xxx" isn't always easy to determine if the string is fixed
as you suggest. What should it be for a sensor measuring an output voltage ?

	input@0 {
		reg = <0>;
		label = "output voltage";
	};

Anyway, maybe Rob has an idea how to name this properly.

Not my call to make about nfactor or n-factor, really. I'll leave that
for Rob to decide.

[ side note: Since the value is just a register value, "two's complement" seems
  unnecessary and confusing; in the context of the DT description it doesn't
  really matter what the register values actually mean. ]

I suspect it should be 0..255. After all, the values reflect register values,
not their meaning. But I don't really know. Rob ?
