I see. So the ACPI-WMI mapper doesn't really "handle" UTF-16, then. Not in the
same way it does UTF-8.

I can't remember where, but I know I've dealt with these length-prefixed
UTF-16 strings before when touching other Microsoft offerings. So maybe this
string was originally inserted as 'Buffer (0x00,0x34,0x00,0x42,...0x00,0x00)'
and 'Unicode ("4BIOS...")' [1] is just how iasl decompiles it.

Either way, someone at HP realized all of this, and instead of just changing
this one string back to a regular string like every other similar string in
the same BIOS - and probably every other BIOS they'd ever seen - kept it.

On purpose.

Sigh.

Interesting. These HP machines represent a WMI array of strings as individual ACPI
String elements in an ACPI Package, so I assumed arrays of other types would be
individual elements as well.

Thanks for your work on the WMI subsystem side. Looking forward to when this,
BMOF decoding, and an unmarshaling mechanism are in the kernel and drivers can
work with WMI data types only.
