Just for my clarification, it seems that what you're implying is that
the embedded EC still uses the SMbus to access those paged registers,
and so needs to use the same mechanism that an external device would
use.  If that's true, ugh.  If it has its own private access to the
entire register set in one "address space", it could bypass the paging
mechanism.

I guess the next time I build a Linux machine, I should pay attention
to the type of Super I/O chip, but I'm guessing there's no search
selection for that on Newegg  :D
