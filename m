It is possible. Making a userspace tool with just a loop of read/writes
will get you wrong readings in the driver sometimes.
Removing hidraw from the drivers is not a solution, because there are
many userspace tools for these devices and it should be an expected use case
to have them running at the same time (eg OpenRGB for rgb)

I think the correct solution would be to lock hidraw while the
drivers are doing requests.
After a (short) look:
Introducing a mutex in the hidraw struct which would be locked in
hidraw_ioctl and could also be locked in the corsair-psu and
corsair-cpro drivers could be a solution.
If there are no objections or better suggestions, I will try this
over the weekend.

Greetings
Marius
