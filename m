That should not be a problem as long as you instantiate them differently.
After all, the relevant information _should_ be available in ACPI tables.
Otherwise you'd have to claim that a chip is, say, tps53688, while it is
really an Infineon chip. And that is never a good idea.

Unfortunately not, because there is no standard defining those. TI might
at some point decide to sell a new chip where 0x03 means something completely
different. On top of that, I already know that at least some of the TI chips
of this series have more than two pages. Unfortunately, the information I have
is vague (no datasheet again). That is another reason for avoiding pollution
of the tps driver with non-TI chip support.
