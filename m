I'm getting similar variance. Compiling Linux seems to spike the temperature above 70, even with a new CPU cooler, so I'm wondering if there might be an offset I'm missing. It may just be the fan being too slow (going to be reconfiguring the BIOS settings today).

The reason I haven't replied sooner is because I've been busy with a new job, and I wasn't sure if my phone would send a properly (un)formatted email. I'm fine with whosever patch gets in, so long as temperature reading works on my machine.

Also, for what it's worth, I'm not a "he". Vicki is generally a female name.
