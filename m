I have NCT6798D on my machine and I also double-checked the chip marking
on the motherboard. I just looked at the 96's datasheet (not found a
98's one). Even with 98 this configuration seems to be correct. Looks
like at least on some revisions of 98 it is not reserved and usable.
The fan in controlled correctly with this setting.

I successfully accessed them. The access procedure is poorly described
but quite simple.

Each of these "HM Read-Only" registers is just a plain I/O port. Just
inb() reads them. Their addresses are sequential. The base address
(address of register 00) is configured similar to the main I/O address
(the one which is usually 0x295). Its MSB is in register 0x64 and its
LSB is in 0x65 of the SuperIO. Like that:

  superio_select(sioreg, NCT6775_LD_HWM);
  hm_ro_base = superio_inb(sioreg, 0x64) << 8;
  hm_ro_base |= superio_inb(sioreg, 0x65);

  // on my machine hm_ro_base == 0x800

  val = inb(hm_io_base + hm_reg);

Hope this helps.

Regards,

Alexey
