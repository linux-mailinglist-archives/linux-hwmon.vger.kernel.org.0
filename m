Not really. My suggested solution would have been to use a value of '0'
to indicate 'disabled' and document it accordingly.

Yes, sure, freely. You conveniently ignore

Do not create non-standard attributes unless really needed. If you have to use
non-standard attributes, or you believe you do, discuss it on the mailing list
first. Either case, provide a detailed explanation why you need the non-standard
attribute(s). Standard attributes are specified in Naming and data format
standards for sysfs files.

from Documentation/hwmon/submitting-patches.rst.

Oh, I really don't want to keep arguing, especially after your "freely"
above. Do whatever you want, just keep it out of drivers/hwmon.
