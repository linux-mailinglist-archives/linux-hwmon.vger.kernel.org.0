Well, I did spent some time on the gpio thing so I would like to have it in=
 but yeah,
no hard feelings if it does not go in.

So, I actually talk with some hw guys and the pull_low is not really like a=
 pull_low
resistor. These pins are effectively an open drain. Which means, setting th=
em as
input means setting them in high-z (turning off the mosffet) - and I do hav=
e a bug in
my code regarding this - Or if you want them as outputs you can set the lev=
el low
(and it will always be low - just turn on the mosffet) or you can also set =
high-z
which means it will be either low or high depending on your external circui=
try. The
point is, you can still have your pin acting as a normal gpo if you accommo=
date your
circuitry for it (can also use these pins for things like buses).

Also got me thinking if a gpi vs gpo devicetree property would make sense. =
But I
would likely leave it more generic/relaxed for now (even though I think you=
 would
need to be creative and actually use more HW to have the possibility of usi=
ng these
pins as GPIs and GPOs at the same time).
