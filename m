Kind of a catch-22. Node names weren't consistent nor checked, so 
we can use them.

Not valid because you have same address twice.

Didn't we already discuss this?

Does measuring a voltage have a direction?

No, I don't have a sense of the range of h/w...

That's fine.

You can define it as a signed type, but the validation there is not 
working due to dts->dt.yaml losing the sign.
