I would just turn off the fan in shutdown and see if anyone complains.

No. I believe the fix was to use pinctrl modes to force the state. And
I think the issue was for suspend rather than shutdown (but it seems
unlikely you'd want the fan off in suspend and on in shutdown).

Do they need to? I'd assume most SoC's are powered off or put in reset
which makes the PWN pin go low.
