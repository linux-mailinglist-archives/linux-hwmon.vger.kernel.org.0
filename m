I have no clue what that entails, but I am assuming: fixing bugs, accepting=
, reviewing patches for that driver, then forwarding them upstream, maybe a=
lso updating the code base according to the best practices at the moment fr=
om time to time, correct?

I would certainly volunteer if it is needed.
