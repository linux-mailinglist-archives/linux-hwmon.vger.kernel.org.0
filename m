I will add a property "ti,shunt-gain". Since the ina209, ina219,
ina220 use the PGA term which is the actual function being provided,
where ADCRANGE=0 is a /4 PGA for ina238 and the other devices have /1,
/2, /4, /8.

Dump of registers below. Other notes, upper two bits are ignored so
the address space wraps at 0x40, etc. The undocumented/unused
registers between 0x11 and 0x3e are 0xffff.

power on, before probe:
0x00: 0x0000
0x01: 0xfb68
0x02: 0x1000
0x03: 0xffff
0x04: 0x087c
0x05: 0x0e77
0x06: 0x0f10
0x07: 0x087c
0x08: 0x01eac3
0x09: 0xffff
0x10: 0x7ff0
0x11: 0xffff
0x3e: 0x5449
0x3f: 0x2381

after probe, actual state of device ~10mV shunt voltage, 20 mOhm
shunt, ~12V bus, ~6W power, ~30C temperature
0x00: 0x0000
0x01: 0xfb6a
0x02: 0x4000
0x03: 0xffff
0x04: 0x087c
0x05: 0x0e77
0x06: 0x0f10
0x07: 0x087c
0x08: 0x01eac3
0x09: 0xffff
0x10: 0x7ff0
0x11: 0xffff
0x3e: 0x5449
0x3f: 0x2381

Thanks,
Nathan
