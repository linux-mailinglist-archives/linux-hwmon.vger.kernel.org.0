I have a CF-SR4 and Linux works out of the box. Compared to
previous models, this one seems to have the fans running at high speed
by default when the computer starts.

When Windows 11 is booted up, the high fan speeds persist just until the
login screen. Once the login screen shows up, the fan spins down.

I had suspected that this might be the laptop ramping down the fans when
the OS declares that it is Windows but this does not seem to be the
case.

After analyzing the DSDT and SSDT of the computer, I have found the
following:

File ssdt10.dsl under \_SB.PC00.LPCB.EC0:

Name (CEFM, Zero)
Method (SEFM, 1, Serialized)
{
    CEFM = Arg0
    REFM ()
}

Method (REFM, 0, Serialized)
{
    If ((\S0IX == 0x03))
    {
        Local0 = 0x05
    }
    ElseIf ((CEFM == Zero))
    {
        Local0 = Zero
    }
    Else
    {
        Local0 = 0x02
    }

    \_SB.PC00.LPCB.EC0.EC88 (0xB5, 0x79, Local0, Zero)
}

\_SB.PC00.LPCB.EC0.CEFM would seem be the current value
for the fan profile. On startup, this is set to 0.

Based on the code SEFM seems the be the method to set the fan
profile and REFM is executed right after.

I don't have access to information as to what the argument officially
means but based on testing, any number above zero makes the fans spin
down and behave like the older models where it stops or runs at low
speed when its cool and ramps up when the processor gets hot.

The only relevant values for CEFM seem to be just 0 and any number above
that just gets treated the same. I personally use just 0 and 1.
0 seems to be the high fan speed mode and 1 makes it behave like
Windows.

Giving 0 as an argument reverts the fan back to the way it was during
startup where the lowest fan speed is quite high and when load is
applied, it seems to ramp up to an even higher speed which I think would
be its 100%.

A value of 1 seems to have its max speed capped lower than 0.

For both modes, fan management is still automatic.

fan_mode only shows up in sysfs only if \_SB.PC00.LPCB.EC0.CEFM and
\_SB.PC00.LPCB.EC0.SEFM are both present which should mean it should not
show up on unsupported models. I have tried not hiding it and it just
outputs a generic error when the value is read.

I also saw that variables such as eco_mode are kept in memory, however
for fan_mode I rely on getting and setting the value via ACPI.

Thank you for pointing out hwmon and pwm. I have made significant
changes and rewrote the fan control so its registered as an hwmon pwm
device. I have also added it to the thermal subsystem.
All the fan sysfs functions have been removed.

I have also added the missing includes:
> +#include <linux/printk.h>
> +#include <linux/sysfs.h>

And I have added the following as I intend to use hwmon, thermal and
DMI:
> +#include <linux/hwmon.h>
> +#include <linux/hwmon-sysfs.h>
> +#include <linux/thermal.h>
> +#include <linux/dmi.h>

I have added this for the errors I used such as EOPNOTSUPP:
> +#include <asm-generic/errno.h>

To play it safe, I think I should only assume that the fan works for my
specific model. I have looked into the other drivers and how this can be
implemented . Using quirks seems to be the standard way.

I had based it from asus-nb-wmi.c
The hwmon and thermal cooling (cdev) device registration will not happen
unless the vendor and product name match.

> +	/* use hwmon convention for pwm_mode */

In this part, I originally used the actual numerical values for the fan
being in EC mode and in manual mode. However, it may be confusing so I
declared it:

> +#define ACPI_PCC_FAN_PWM_AUTO	0x00
> +#define ACPI_PCC_FAN_PWM_MANUAL	0x01
> +#define HWMON_PCC_FAN_PWM_AUTO	0x00
> +#define HWMON_PCC_FAN_PWM_MANUAL	0x01

The values are the same but I made the distinction between the hwmon
standard value and what the ACPI function returns.
This might be useful for readability or if it is changed
or modified in the future.

> +	struct thermal_cooling_device	*pwm_fan_cdev;

While I did register the hwmon device with devm so it does not need
cleanup, this is not the case with the thermal cooling device. I added
it to the pcc_acpi struct so it can be properly cleaned up when the
driver is unloaded.

Currently, with an unmodified driver, there is a fan exposed by ACPI but
it always reads N/A when viewed using the sensors command:

acpi_fan-isa-0000
Adapter: ISA adapter
fan1:             N/A

The output is the same regardless of whether or not the fan is
controlled by the EC or manually.

When the computer starts up, control is always handed over to the
EC. Even on a restart, the BIOS will switch it back to EC control.
When a Linux OS boots up, it is expected that the PWM fan will read
N/A as the value from _FST (fan status) is not related at all to the
actual speed the fan is running.

panasonic_pwm_fan-isa-0000
Adapter: ISA adapter
pwm1:              N/A

When in manual mode, it will look like the ff:

panasonic_pwm_fan-isa-0000
Adapter: ISA adapter
pwm1:              0%  MANUAL CONTROL

I do have a question I want to ask regarding fan control. There is an
ACPI command that needs to be called first to set the fan to manual
control. When in EC mode, setting the fan speed via _FSL will not do
anything. This is why the code will check the current fan mode first
before setting the fan level.

Should the code automatically set the fan to manual mode first when the
fan speed is set?

For example,
$ echo 50 | sudo tee "/sys/devices/platform/MAT0019:00/hwmon/hwmon6/pwm1"

If the following is executed and the fan is still controlled by the EC,
should the driver automatically run the command to switch the fan into
manual mode? The current behavior is it does for both hwmon and thermal.

For the hwmon and thermal device I have named it the following:
hwmon: "panasonic_pwm_fan"
> +		hwmon_dev = devm_hwmon_device_register_with_info(
> +			&pdev->dev, "panasonic_pwm_fan", NULL,
> +			&pcc_pwm_fan_hwmon_chip_info, NULL);
thermal: "Panasonic_PWM_Fan"
> +		pcc->pwm_fan_cdev = thermal_cooling_device_register(
> +			"Panasonic_PWM_Fan", NULL, &pcc_pwm_fan_cdev_ops);

If it would be more helpful I can put these into a #define at the top of
the file.

I am currently using this patch on my computer and it works with
thermald. Though I need to specify which cooling device type to use.

The way the fan works:
\_SB.PC00.LPCB.EC0.SEFM - 0 for EC and 1 for manual (there is a 5 but
that seems to be reserved for S01X sleep)

\_SB.PC00.LPCB.EC0.TFN1._FSL - accepts 0-100 and appears to be the
standard _FSL function defined in the ACPI spec but in a non-standard
path. If set without setting the fan mode, it is ignored by the system.
0 turns off the fan and 100 sets it to full speed. When the command is
given, the EC slowly ramps up the fan speed (not instant).

\_SB.PC00.LPCB.EC0.TFN1._FST - the second element contains the current
fan speed. This is only reflective of actual speed when the fan mode is
set to manual.

When in manual mode, the EC intervenes to turn the fan on if the
processor gets hot (around ~90 degrees Celsius).

The fan would be controlled like this from the OS:
In the case of hwmon:
$ echo 0 | sudo tee /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon6/pwm1 # turn fan off
$ echo 255 | sudo tee /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon6/pwm1 # full speed
$ echo 70 | sudo tee /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon6/pwm1 # any value in between
$ echo 0 | sudo tee /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon6/pwm1_enable # EC mode
$ echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon6/pwm1_enable # manual mode

Setting a speed via hwmon will automatically put the fan into manual
mode. This will be reflected when pwm1_enable is called.

For thermal:
$ echo 0 | sudo tee /sys/class/thermal/cooling_device14/cur_state # off
$ echo 100 | sudo tee /sys/class/thermal/cooling_device14/cur_state # max
$ echo 50 | sudo tee /sys/class/thermal/cooling_device14/cur_state # 50%

The driver always queries the current state of the fan (both the fan
speed and the fan mode) from ACPI and does not retain the state within
the module.

To summarize, I have added hwmon and thermal for the fan. To prevent
this from affecting other models, I have implemented quirks that use DMI
vendor and product name.

For thermald I currently use the thermal subsystem to control the fan
via trip points. With this patch and thermald, it is now set and forget on my
computer (the fan is not stuck at ~80% anymore).

I have also added one more modification that was not mentioned
earlier.

> +#define pr_fmt(fmt) KBUILD_MODNAME ": " fmt

I have added this at the top of the file so that messages from this
module are more easily identified.

> [93927.430133] Unknown hotkey event: 0x0031
I get a lot of these on dmesg and having it be:
> [93927.430133] panasonic_laptop: Unknown hotkey event: 0x0031
instead makes it easier to determine where this is from.
(happens when I press the fn key)

For this one I have added checks to make sure only values 0-100 are set.
Its not sysfs input so kstrtouint is not used anymore.

Thank you for taking a look.
