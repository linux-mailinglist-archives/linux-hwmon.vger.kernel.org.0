Hello Uwe, hello Guenter,

maybe it's because I needed to test the driver in Linux 5.10 on my custom
embedded device. I compiled the driver also in the new Kernel, always
rebasing on the latest master but testing its behavior was done in 5.10.=20
So thats maybe why the deprecated probe_new function pointer was still in=
 the driver.
So also from my side, sorry for the extra effort.

Regards,

Andre
