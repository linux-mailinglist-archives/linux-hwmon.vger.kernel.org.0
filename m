Don't change something that isn't broken. Again, if a user wants to use
userspace tools to access PSU data, that user should only use userspace
tools. If there is a real problem with parallel accesses from userspace
and the kernel, maybe we can configure the driver such that it blocks
userspace access while the driver is loaded. Everything else seems
overkill (such the idea of mutexes covering multiple subsystems, if I
understand that correctly). Anyone who wants to use userspace tools
can then just disable or unload the kernel driver.
