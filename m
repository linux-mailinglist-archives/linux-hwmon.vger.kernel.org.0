Unfortunately, this just leads to the current result where the it87
module is almost useless, as there are no current chips supported and all
we get is regular requests to support current chip.  We need to work out
some way around the support, with or without support by the vendor.  I
also suspect we can get better support from Gigabyte and ITE if we are
trying to do something ourselves.

From a personal viewpoint I haven't seen any stability issues from the
current out of tree module, but then that is only my experience.  Even
then some instability seems to be common across a number of drivers and
as long as we work to resolve it I feel it will be accepted.

As for the how to apply the patches, that is where I will need some help,
as we now have over 5 years of changes to try and split up.

Regards
Frank
