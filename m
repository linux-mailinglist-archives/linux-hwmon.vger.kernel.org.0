The OOT scenario is something I have not handled yet specifically, or
have had happen.

Systemd will restart the service in the case of OOT after 5 seconds
and in the case of a crash there are multiple fallbacks to ensure the
custom curve turns off.

Most of the hibernation hangs that I have experienced happen before
journalctl turns on, so I assumed that it's before userspace
unfreezes. I am also not sure if restore() gets to run in those cases
or not.

I think this is what Luke tried to do with the Zotac Zone. But in the
end, the kernel is limited to what calculations it can do, esp.
floating point and what it can access, so you end up with a worse
curve with limited extendability, and a driver specific ABI. And we
also risk duplicating all of this code on hwmon drivers and making it
harder to access.

I think part of this reason is why the platform side of the Zotac
stuff has not been upstreamed, even though the driver itself other
than that is pretty straightforward with an established ABI by now.
And it is also the reason we have not been able to add the module to
Bazzite, because 1) we cannot validate the new fan curve calculations
without a device and 2) they are worse that what we provide through
userspace (a polynomial ramp-up which embeds hysteresis to avoid
jittering, plus choice for both Edge and Tctl sensors).

In summary, I think there would great potential for a common set of
"hwmon" helpers that can use a temperature function and a speed set
function to handle a basic multi-point curve for basic, e.g., udev
use-cases. To that end, there could be a helper with a 5 second
timeout that turns off the custom speed. But it would be good for that
to be implemented globally, so it does not block device hw enablement.

As far as this driver is concerned, I will handle the hibernation case
with a lazy resume, per what I said in the previous email.
