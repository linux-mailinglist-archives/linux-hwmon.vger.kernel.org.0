This phrasing is confusing to me. That's once again that "configured to"=20
which in this context doesn't refer to the kernel, but to an initial config=20=

of the chip. I suggest the following:

Fan channels 7..12 are only available when the chip has been configured=20
with PWM output N-6 disabled. This configuration is outside of scope of the=20=

kernel. The displayed status matches the value of the companion channel but=20=

is read-only.

I realize that it probably doesn't belong to this patch because it affects=20=

the other fan_* files, but the docs would be improved by something like:

 Tachometer inputs monitor fan tachometer logic outputs for precise (+/-1%)
 monitoring and control of fan RPM as well as detection of fan failure.
 Six pins are dedicated tachometer inputs. Any of the six PWM outputs can
-also be configured to serve as tachometer inputs.
+also be reconfigured to serve as tachometer inputs by the firmware. The
+kernel will respect the initial configuration of the chip.

Want an extra patch on top of this series?

This means that a "nonsensical" write from userspace will be silently=20
ignored, doesn't it? I think it should return an error instead.
