Okay, I'm sorry, maybe 'duplication' was a bad choice of words from my part.

You had told that having multiple hwmon device for a single chip was not
acceptable.

But I'm trying to explain that we have a hardware architecture where the graphics
is duplicated in 'tiles' inside the same PCI card. Each tile with its
own sensors and monitoring systems. And also an extra sensors monitoring the
entire 'package' that includes the tiles and the SoC.
So 1 hwmon device per gt-tile and package sound the appropriated way to me.

Your lines had convinced Badal to get them all and merge in a single hwmon
device. If we do this, the API will get messed up.

And this is what I meant by 'messed up':
quoting Badal:
"""
With single device energy entries will look like hwmonxx/energy1_input,
energy2_input, energy3_input.
To identify which entry for what need to expose additional entry energyX_lable
which will contain ("package", "gtN")
"""

I am arguing that for this tiled ('sub-device') hw architecture the
initial patch from Badal, that is the same way implemented in i915 is
absolutely the right way to go with the current infrastructure.

One idea that I had the first time that I saw this was if it wouldn't
be acceptable for instance in hwmon an infra with named (numbered?)
sub-directories inside the the hwmon device. But I couldn't not find any
other hwmon usage out there that could justify a big change in the core of
hwmon like that.

Well, but maybe we are indeed missing some other better way of handling
this sub-device case with the current hwmon infrastructure. If so, I'd
like to hear more about the suggestions and get some initial pointers.

Thanks so much for your time and help here,
Rodrigo.
