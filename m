For example, say that there are two ACPI thermal zones on a system

/sys/devices/virtual/thermal/thermal_zone0/
/sys/devices/virtual/thermal/thermal_zone1/

The current mainline code registers a hwmon class device for thermal_zone0 =
only:

/sys/devices/virtual/thermal/thermal_zone0/hwmon0/

because the type is "acpitz" for both of them, but it adds a sysfs
attribute that belongs to thermal_zone1 under it:

/sys/devices/virtual/thermal/thermal_zone0/hwmon0/temp2_input

There is also

/sys/devices/virtual/thermal/thermal_zone0/hwmon0/temp1_input

but it belongs to thermal_zone0.

Interesting things happen when thermal_zone0 is removed, for example
because the ACPI thermal driver is unbound from the underlying
platform device.  Namely, the removal code skips the removal of hwmon0
because of the temp2_input attribute belonging to thermal_zone1 which
effectively prevents thermal_zone0 removal from making progress.

AFAICS, nothing particularly smart can be done to address this issue
while retaining the current design of the code.  Reparenting hwmon0 to
thermal_zone1 may confuse user space as well as removing hwmon0 along
with temp2_input.  That's why I think that this is a design issue.

I'm not sure if this has anything to do with hardware monitoring chips
because hwmon_device_register_for_thermal() sets the chip argument of
__hwmon_device_register() to NULL, so the chip information is missing
in this particular case.  The underlying hardware may or may not be a
multi-channel hardware monitoring chip, that is hard to tell in
general.

In the particular case of ACPI thermal zones, they each correspond to
a different platform device and regarding those as different channels
of the same hardware monitoring chip is kind of a stretch IMV (they
may even be located at different places in the device hierarchy).

Regardless, it should be possible to remove each of them cleanly
because they are handled by the driver independently.
