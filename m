Non-standard attribute discussions always require a lot of time,
since I have to re-read the chip documentation and try to understand
the reasoning why the attributes are needed. On top of that,
asking me "what should I do" instead of suggesting possible
solutions for me to choose from takes even more time, which
unfortunately I don't have right now. I'll try to get to it,
but, sorry, I can not promise you a time right now.
