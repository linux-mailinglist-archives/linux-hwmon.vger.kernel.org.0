I have no preference for which subsystem these helpers are placed if
implemented. But if thermal handlers are implemented they need to be
global. This includes timeouts for manual control and basic fan curves
(for which the ABI belongs to hwmon).

I cannot make manufacturer specific workarounds for X platform 6 point
curve because it was determined XYZ this and that, when the
manufacturer provides direct control.

Speaking of which, what is the policy for hwmon when it comes to
settings after hibernation. I am being asked to add a restore hook for
hwmon settings here, but other relevant drivers do not have it
(asuswmi, gpdfan, oxpec), is a new requirement for hwmon?
