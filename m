I really like your proposition but I guess we need to wait few more days 
for the feedback.

But have some questions here.

What about potential next steps when we all agreed to follow that 
approach. Should documentation modification reach upstream repository 
first and then e.g. pmbus hwmon module implementation?


Thanks
