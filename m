How about a platform driver which loads the parameters into device
properties from whatever location and instantiates the pmbus driver ?
The PMBus driver would then read the device attributes and instantiate
itself accordingly.

If the other PMBus attributes can be auto-detected, it might actually be
sufficient to have a per-page vrm-mode property and otherwise use the
auto-detect mechanism of pmbus.c.
