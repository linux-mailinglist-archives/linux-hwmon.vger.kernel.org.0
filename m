There is a specific API for exclusive regulators which the driver is not
using, and it's unconditionally doing the disable/enable cycle here.

The driver needs to be explicitly configured for this and have separate
code paths for normal operation and operation where the supply can be
bounced like this.  In neither code path should the supply be optional.
Right now we don't have a mechanism for discovering optionally exclusive
and enable/disablable supplies which is what the device needs, we could
potentially add that since this does seem like a viable use case and we
already have enough information in the DT to say if the supply matches
the constraints.  Probably the two properties queryable separately.  If
that API were added then the driver would do a normal regulator_get()
then check if it has the capabilities it needs and either keep the
supply on all the time (or possibly just during measurements?) or enable
the alarm functionality.
