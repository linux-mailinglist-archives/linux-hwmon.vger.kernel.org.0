Here a more detailed description, which I would add to
Documentation/hwmon/ in the proper form:

The PLC devices use a coin cell battery for the RTC to keep the current
time. The goal is to provide information about the coin cell state to
user space. Actually the user space shall be informed that the coin cell
battery is nearly empty and needs to be replaced.

The coin cell must be tested actively to get to know if its nearly empty
or not. Therefore, a load is put on the coin cell and the resulting
voltage is evaluated. This evaluation is done by some hard wired analog
logic, which compares the voltage to a defined limit. If the voltage is
above the limit, then the coin cell is assumed to be ok. If the voltage
is below the limit, then the coin cell is nearly empty (or broken,
or removed, ...) and shall be replaced by a new one. The battery
controller allows to start the test of the coin cell and to get the
result if the voltage is above or below the limit. The actual voltage is
not available. Only the information if the voltage is below a limit is
available.

That's why I thought a voltage alarm is a good fit. But I'm not an
expert and I'm curious about your opinion.

I'm sorry, I only wanted to mention where the idea comes from. I will
start with channel 0.
