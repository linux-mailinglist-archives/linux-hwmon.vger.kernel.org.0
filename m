I tested the assumption by explicitly attempting to switch the SPD5118
page in i2c_probe()
using the same mechanism as the existing recovery logic. On my
platform, the write to
SPD5118_REG_I2C_LEGACY_MODE fails with SMBHSTSTS_DEV_ERR, and the page
remains unchanged.
This demonstrates that page selection requires a write and cannot be
performed on platforms
with SPD write disable. Temperature reads therefore only work because
firmware has
pre-selected page 0, and Linux has no way to recover if that state is
lost (e.g. across suspend).
This confirms that a =E2=80=9Cread-only SPD=E2=80=9D mode cannot be made ro=
bust.

/* Simulate later temp read attempts depend on startup page writes */
dev_info(dev, "(i2c-probe) Initial legacy_mode =3D 0x%02x\n", mode);
i2c_smbus_write_byte_data(client, SPD5118_REG_I2C_LEGACY_MODE, mode |
SPD5118_LEGACY_PAGE_MASK);
mode =3D i2c_smbus_read_byte_data(client, SPD5118_REG_I2C_LEGACY_MODE);
dev_info(dev, "(i2c-probe) Updated legacy_mode =3D 0x%02x\n", mode);
