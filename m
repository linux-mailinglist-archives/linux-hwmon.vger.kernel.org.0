Nothing should ever be "arbitrary" but have some reason. Arbitrary is
if you glue all the possible attributes onto a wall and then select the
ones to use by throwing darts at it.

powerX_min, powerX_max and powerX_crit are typically hard limits which
can not actively be influenced without drastic measures such as turning
off some hardware. powerX_cap is supposed to be more flexible; the
assumption is that the hardware or firmware has some means to control power
such that it does not exceed powerX_cap (while maintaining operational
status), for example by modifying operational frequencies.

Nowadays everything may be a bit more flexible; for example, one could
imagine that a modern system could (via software) reduce the operational
frequency of the system if power consumption exceeds powerX_max or
powerX_crit. The distinction would be that with powerX_cap, the hardware
or firmware would in general be in control, while with powerX_max
and powerX_crit the host software would be in control.

powerX_min is supported by the infrastructure. It not being documented
is an oversight.
