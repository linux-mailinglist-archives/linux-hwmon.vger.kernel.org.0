Not exactly, the leading "4" is a hack:

The string "4BIOS Configuration Change" get converted to "\u0034 \u0042 \u=
0049 \u004f \u0053 \u0020 \u0043 \u006f \u006e \u0066 \u0069 \u0067
\u0075 \u0072 \u0061 \u0074 \u0069 \u006f \u006e \u0020 \u0043 \u0068 \u00=
61 \u006e \u0067 \u0065 \u0000",
so without the leading "4", the utf16 string is 52 bytes long.

Since WMI want the utf16 string prefixed with its length (52 =3D 0x34), th=
e leading "4" was added
since the letter "4" gets converted to \u0034 (0x34 =3D 52).

So for WMI, the leading "4" gets interpreted as the length of the followin=
g utf16 string,
so it is not displayed to WMI data consumers.

On my machine (Dell Inspiron 3505), an ACPI WMI method uses a ACPI_TYPE_BU=
FFER
to pass an array of u32, so assuming ACPI_TYPE_BUFFER =3D=3D utf16 is fals=
e.

This shows why linux should do this preprocessing too, because WMI marshal=
s
the _converted_ buffer using the MOF definitions, not the ACPI bobject.

According to Microsoft documentation, the ACPI-WMI mapper converts the ACP=
I object
without having _any_ knowledge of the corresponding MOF definitions. This =
means
that after conversion, the contents of the WMI buffer are only "normalized=
" so
the WMI core does not have to know about ACPI data types.

If linux would also do this "normalization" step, then we would also be ab=
le to
operate on this "normalized" WMI buffer without relying on the ACPI data t=
ypes,
which (like in this case) can use different ways to express the same WMI d=
ata
(string as ACPI string vs string as utf16 buffer).
