The assumption was that the sensors command was _not_ executed prior
to suspend and that this triggers the problem. If it was executed at least
once and the crash on resume still happens, something else must be going
on. Either case, I think it is best to apply the patch suggested by Zev.
We can try to figure out the exact cause of the problem later. Zev, can
you send me a formal patch ? I would like to apply and send it to Linus
as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Guenter
