A misunderstanding. The channel node can be used by every device supported by lm90. At least each
channel of each device can have label.

But isn't the value of offset a hardware-design-time calculation? So if I have a piece of
hardware that describes itself using device-tree, then offset information should be stored on the
device-tree rather then be "calculated" by the software running on that piece of hardware?

And what if such piece of hardware has been changed (e.g. new PCB version) and now the offset are
different? Then if device-tree is on hardware (e.g. on EEPROM) with new offsets, then software would
not require a change to support this new hardware version.

OK, so I will leave millicelsius as the unit.

Ah I see it too. This is not stopping the make dt_bindings_check and that is why I have missed it.
My apologies! I will be more careful next time!
