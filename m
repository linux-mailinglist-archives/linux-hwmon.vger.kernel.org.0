I thought about calling it in probe, but I don't really like it because
it would slow down boot. Let's introduce a namespace (say, NCT6775) instead.
Change all EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(x) to EXPORT_SYMBOL_NS_GPL(x, NCT6775) and
add MODULE_IMPORT_NS(NCT6775) to nct6775-platform.c and nct6775-i2c.c.
This will ensure that the exported symbols can only be called from the
nct6775 code.

Thanks,
Guenter
