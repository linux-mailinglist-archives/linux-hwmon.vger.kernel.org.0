That doesn't sound right. There's no way for the driver to be sure that the
counters did not wrap around before it was loaded. Here's a few scenarios
how such wraparound is possible:

- while the user was messing in the bootloader for a few minutes
- if the user kexec'd a new kernel
- if the counters were not reset during a warm reboot

Ignoring initial values of the counters is generally the right thing to do.
In the specific circumstances when the user wants to measure energy used
since machine power-up, and they know the boot happened so quick the counters
did not wrap around, they can easily script that with e.g. the rdmsr tool.
Or perhaps the driver could pr_info the initial values at probe time.

Have such complaints already appeared in practice?

Also note that documentation doesn't promise that counters start from zero
at power-up time, although that's of course a natural assumption.

No, fudging the initial reading like this wouldn't help, because I was
pointing out how core counters increment quicker than the package counter;
i.e. even if the kernel fudged the initial values, they would still grow
contradictory quick enough (on some workloads).
