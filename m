Or maybe SN1906016 means something else. Unless we have explicit confirmation
that the chip exists (or will exist) we should not add it to the list.

And same as TI, including VOUT_MODE ? Also, did they confirm that the unpublished
chips do or will actually exist ?

Sorry, to be persistent, but give my thanks to Infineon.

Surprise.
