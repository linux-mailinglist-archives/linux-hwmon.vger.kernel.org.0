A gentle reminder that this patch exists, as it has (understandably) gone s=
ilent over the holiday period. I would appreciate some feedback on my ideas=
 before modifying the patch, so I know I am headed in the right direction.=

=0A=
That is true, but as the function of register 0x73 bit 5 differs=0A=
between the two set of hardware ({adt7473, adt7475} and {adt7476,=0A=
adt7490}) a solution which allows bypassing VCCP on both gets more=0A=
complicated which I was trying to avoid.=0A=
=0A=
Is it acceptable to split the function=0A=
load_individual_bypass_attenuators into two, one for each set of=0A=
chips, and call the appropriate function for the chip? That way adding=0A=
"bypass-attenuator-in1" to any of the four adt chips DTS will result in=0A=
the attenuator for VCCP being bypassed (albeit by setting different=0A=
bits depending on the specific bit).=0A=

>=0A=
=0A=
Only a power cycle (after removing the properties from the DTS) will=0A=
set the affected bits back to 0. Removing the properties, but only=0A=
softly restarting the system (no interrupted power supply to the adt=0A=
chip), will not set the bits back to 0.=0A=
=0A=
I decided against setting the bits to 0 by default (if no property was=0A=
present) as doing so might break compatibility with systems that expect=0A=
the bits to remain unchanged.=0A=
=0A=
A compromise would be to change the "bypass-attenuator-inx" property to=0A=
"bypass-attenuator-inx =3D <y>", where y =3D 1 bypasses the attenuator and=
=0A=
y =3D 0 does not. If the property is not present then the register is=0A=
left unchanged. It would make sense to do the same to the "bypass-=0A=
attenuator-all" property. Would these changes be acceptable?=0A=

=0A=
There would be no practical purpose, it was to keep the example=0A=
compact. Instead "bypass-attenuator-in1" could be removed and added to=0A=
second device hwmon@2d. This would show off the syntax for each set of=0A=
properties in a more practical way.=0A=
