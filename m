I don't really know what to say or recommend here. Personally I think any
attempt to tie PWM values to RPM are doomed to fail. Here are a couple of
examples:

Take your test system and move the fan to a restricted place (eg close to a
wall). You'll see the fan RPM change, potentially significantly. Put it into
some place with airflow towards or away from the system (eg blow air into
the system from another place, which may happen if the system is installed
in a lab), and again you'll see fan speed changes. Open the chassis, and
the fan speed will change. I have seen fan speeds vary by up to 50% when
changing airflow.

That doesn't even take into account that replacing a fan even with a similar
model (eg after a fan failed) will likely result in potentially significant
rpm changes.

Ultimately, anything that does more than determine if a fan is still running
is potentially unstable.

Having said all that, it is really your call to decide how you want to detect
fan failures. 

Thanks,
Guenter
