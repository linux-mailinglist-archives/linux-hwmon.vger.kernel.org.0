Great, thanks.

Guenter, it looks like nct6775_suspend() really does in fact need to use 
nct6775_update_device() instead of dev_get_drvdata(), though it's not 
immediately obvious to me why.  Though given that the bulk of of the 
body of nct6775_update_device() is inside an 'if' block that might not 
necessarily execute every time, I also wonder if it might be vulnerable 
to exhibiting the same problem depending on timing.

Zoltán, if you could try another experiment to try to gather some data 
on that -- with the patch from my previous email still applied, could 
you try suspending via:

     $ cat /sys/bus/platform/drivers/nct6775/nct6775.*/hwmon/hwmon*/*_input && echo mem > /sys/power/state

and see if suspend is broken again?  The idea being to read from the 
hwmon device's sensors and then immediately suspend so that the 
nct6775_update_device() call from nct6775_suspend() falls within the 
driver's 1.5 second cache window and hence skips most of the work that 
function does.  If the same problem starts occurring again that way, it 
seems we've had essentially the same bug lurking for a while and the 
change in the patch you bisected to just made it happen consistently 
instead of unpredictably.  If suspend/resume continues working however, 
then I'm quite mystified, because the only other thing that's happening 
in that function is a mutex lock/unlock.


Thanks,
Zev
