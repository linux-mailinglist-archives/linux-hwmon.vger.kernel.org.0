IMO, submitting patches to linux is already not the most straightforward th=
ing in the
world. If we are now going to ask to run smatch, cocci, sparse and so on, w=
e will
scare even more developers from the community... I mean, the bots are also =
in place
to help with these kind of more advanced analysis, right?

>=20

For the record, I do care about the code I submit and missing 'static' is q=
uite
embarrassing, yes. The only reason why I still dind't send the v3 fixing th=
at is
because I'm giving more time to see if you can review some of the other cha=
nges. I'm
pretty sure I'll be asked to change more things in v2 (as stated in the cov=
er, there
are still some shady things in the driver).
