Yes you are right, except for Voltages for which we only have the "SMI Voltage status" @1E to get a status, and as this is an SMI 
status register it does not work as simple non-SMI status registers.
So the good nexs is that there's nothing to fix for temperatures and fans because the driver is only using the non-SMI status 
registers for them, and they have their bits set as long as we are out of range (not cleared by read).

Good idea, I'm going to work on it and make sure there's no risk to miss a transition and then have a staled status.
