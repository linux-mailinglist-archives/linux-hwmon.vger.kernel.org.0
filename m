Drop the label and result variable, and do returns directly:

Don't print __func__ in anything meant for normal user consumption, write

I suggest you always initialize the mutex. Doing it conditionally it made 
your cleanup trickier (and more prone to corner cases if somebody changes 
some of the checks). What's the benefit for doing in conditionally?
