Oh, okay. Yes, you are right. A lot happend since 2016, I have to admit,
I was updating the driver code, but haven't kept track with the THERMAL
change.

So, I'm planning to address your comments in the following way:
	- Drop imply THERMAL (no replacement)
	- add __maybe_unused to the new functions+struct
	  In the !THERMAL case, compilers will spot the static declarations.
	  If you prefer, I could instead add a #ifdef CONFIG_THERMAL [...] #endif
	  around the new cooling functions and the tc654_fan_cool_ops struct.

	- Changed in tc654_probe() that IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_THERMAL) to
					IS_BUILTIN(CONFIG_THERMAL)

Thanks again for the pointer :).

Cheers,
Christian
