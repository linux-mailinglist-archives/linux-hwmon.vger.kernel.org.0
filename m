I have a functional patch (see below), but before going further (split and cleanup), I would like to have your opinion on how the 
NCT7802Y handles the thresholds status.
Except for temperatures and in "comparator interrupt mode", the status bits are NOT set after each ADC conversion, but only once 
when crossing a threshold. So an alarm for a threshold is reported only to the first process reading the status and not to the others.
For instance if you run "sensors" you only get "ALARM" once the nothing until the threshold is crossed again in the other direction. 
Maybe the expected behaviour would be to display "ALARM" as long as we are outside the thresholds, not only once.
