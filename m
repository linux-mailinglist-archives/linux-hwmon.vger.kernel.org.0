"Precise (+/-1%)" sounds like chip advertising, which I'd rather avoid.

Trade-off between confusing users and trying to match the ABI with somewhat
odd chip capabilities. The above isn't exactly specified; it is the result
of trial and error (and a reason why the configuration register must be
treated as volatile when using regmap).

One can argue one way or another. For now I'd rather keep the code as is
because I am away from the evaluation board for the next few weeks and
won't be able to test any functional changes until I am back.
Given the complexity of the chip and its sometimes odd behavior I'll want
to be able to do that kind of testing. Is this important for you ? If so,
we can move forward with patches 1-3 of the series and leave this and
subsequent patches for later.

Thanks,
Guenter
