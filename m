Hi Guenter,

Thanks for the continued review and for questioning the earlier
direction =E2=80=94 that helped narrow this down properly.

After enabling full i801 debug logging (included below in this email)
and inspecting both drivers, it became clear that the resume
failures are not caused by spd5118 accessing the hardware too
early, nor by PM ordering issues. Instead, the SMBus controller
explicitly reports =E2=80=9CSPD Write Disable is set=E2=80=9D, and any
block write transactions to the SPD device consistently fail with
DEV_ERR. spd5118 merely propagates the resulting -ENXIO.

With that in mind, I have dropped the earlier patch that attempted
to remove hardware access from the suspend path
unconditionally.
That patch does not address the root cause and is no longer
part of the series.

I am instead proposing a minimal 2-patch series:

1/2 records whether the platform enforces SPD write disable at probe
time (no behavior change).
2/2 avoids regcache writeback during suspend/resume when the device
operates in read-only mode, while still allowing read access to
temperature inputs.

This avoids issuing SMBus transactions that are architecturally
blocked on these systems, and does not rely on
delays or PM ordering assumptions, and leaves behavior unchanged on
platforms where SPD writes are permitted.

If this direction looks acceptable, I=E2=80=99m happy to re-spin and post t=
he
series formally.

Thanks again for the guidance.
