That's true but still are too many things to remember for every single chan=
ge/driver
one sends upstream. Yeah, I might just wrap b4 in a script to run more adva=
nced
checks on my patches before 'send'.

Yeah, but actually thanks to you, I discovered I can have my private branch=
es covered
by lkp (and I got the PR merged already) and I do not mind having 1/2 day d=
elay for
sending patches. So maybe that will help me avoid these kind of mistakes.
