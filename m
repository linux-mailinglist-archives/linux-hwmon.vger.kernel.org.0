That is part of the conversion to any of the new APIs, and intentional.
If that is unacceptable for some reason, you'll have to stick with the old
API and accept the warning. Abusing the new APIs is not acceptable.

You have a point. However, if anything, that means that we might have
to improve/extend the hwmon API to make attributes visible or invisible
dynamically (ie add an API call such as hwmon_update_visibility()
and have it call sysfs_update_groups()).
