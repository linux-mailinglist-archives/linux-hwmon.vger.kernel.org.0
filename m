Hi Alexander,

Thanks for using the driver.

I confirmed this with the hardware folks, the definition of package has
changed with the chiplet design. May be the documentation needs an update.

These registers are 32bit counters, they might wrap-around quite faster at
high work loads. So, we used a kernel thread to accumulate the values of
each core and socket to 64bit values.

Depending on when the module is inserted in the system, the initial values
of the counters could be different and we do not have a way to know, how
many time the registers are wrapped around in the past.

Difference of Energy over Time is the best way to use this information.
For example:
at t1 = 0, Read the register before starting the job, say E1.
at t2= 300secs, Read the register after the completion of the job, say E2.
power consumed = (E2-E1)/(t2 - t1) in Watts.

In our evaluation, the sum of the energy consumption of cores of a socket was
always less (actually far lesser) than the socket energy consumption.

One other thing could be the enumeration of the cores of a package in the
Desktop/Laptop systems might need different handling in the read. I will check
this.
