Hello Guenter,

Disabling CONFIG_SENSORS_SPD5118_DETECT completely avoids the issue on
affected platforms,
even without any code changes. This confirms that the failures are
triggered specifically by automatic
SPD5118 instantiation on systems where the i801 controller enforces
SPD Write Disable.
The existing Kconfig already documents that auto-detection is optional
and that, on x86, instantiation
is expected to be coordinated by the SMBus subsystem.

The fact that disabling auto-detection avoids the issue is evidence
that instantiation itself is
unsafe under SPD Write Disable, not that spd5118 is malfunctioning.

The existing Kconfig help already says "Disabling the detect function
will speed up boot time and reduce
the risk of mis-detecting=E2=80=A6", and the attached patch documents the
reason why mis-detection can happen.
