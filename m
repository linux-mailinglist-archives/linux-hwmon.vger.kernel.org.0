According to the datasheet, the status register bits should be set while
voltages are out of range. Are you sure that this is not the case ?

The next question is how the status registers behave. If the bits are set
whenever voltages cross a limit, we could use that knowledge and compare
voltages against limits only after a status register bit was set.
Something like
	if (status register bit is set) {
		alarm = (voltage is out of range);
		cache alarm;
	}
	print alarm;

Thanks,
Guenter
