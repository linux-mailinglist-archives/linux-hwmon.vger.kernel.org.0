Sorry for the confusion. I did not test with corsair-psu. (Do not have
the hardware) I tested with corsair-cpro. Reading temps with userspace and
reading fan speed with the driver simultaneously.
But you are right. This is also not, what a userspace tool should do this
fast and if it doesn't, races are really unlikely.
