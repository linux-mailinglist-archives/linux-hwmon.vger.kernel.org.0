Who knows, maybe the "-S" is for "eSPI".

Two possibilities: There may be more options to enable those fan inputs (ie
different pins) not curently supported by the driver, or there is a fan
multiplexer on the board. Hard if not impossible to say without datasheet.
I think asrock has a configuration utility for Windows which includes
configuration files for the various boards, or at least they used to have
it. Maybe it is possible to install that utility and examine the configuration
file.

I would not call that "odd" just because it is not documented.

That is likely a different chip (ie just another name for NCT6796D).

More likely it is yet another variant.

Almost good, but please mark as "nct6796d-s". The (0xd802) isn't
appropriate here. If anything, you would want something like 0xd800 as
main entry and (0xd802) below to match the other entries.
