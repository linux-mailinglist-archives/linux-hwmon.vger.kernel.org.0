Hi all,=0D
=0D
The LTC4282 hot swap controller allows a board to be safely inserted and=0D
removed from a live backplane. Using one or more external N-channel pass=0D
transistors, board supply voltage and inrush current are ramped up at an=0D
adjustable rate. An I2C interface and onboard ADC allows for monitoring=0D
of board current, voltage, power, energy and fault status.=0D
=0D
I'm aware that there are ABI in the driver that will surely raise questions=
.=0D
So, I'll try to add some comments about those:=0D
=0D
- For the fault_log stuff please see the comment in the code. There might b=
e=0D
some scenarios where one might really want to latch off the device until a=
=0D
fault is manually cleared.=0D
- I also see value in the FET interfaces as they are real faults but maybe=
=0D
the naming is poor.=0D
- I'm not so sure about the power1_good and the power1_fault_log. The=0D
power1_good is more of a real status bit. If the bit is 0, it does not=0D
necessarily means that there's something wrong. If someone removed=0D
(on purpose) the "load", then this will be 0 and there's nothing wrong.=0D
The fault_log is also not one of those bits that will keep the device to=0D
latch on again. However, they might really indicate some misbehave. But,=0D
OTOH (again :)), maybe the GPIO support for this is enough...=0D
- There's also the handling for the overflow bits. I don't think it makes=0D
much sense to export those so I tried to be clever and automatically handle=
=0D
it the driver. The power_average is the thing making the whole thing more=0D
complicated. If it was only the energy, we could defer it completely to=0D
userspace...=0D
- And there's also the rsense as a mandatory property. Designs like this=0D
completely depend on the calculated rsense so I have no idea (and if it=0D
makes sense) what default should I use if the property is not given.=0D
=0D
I'm also cc'ing the GPIO folks for the GPIO bits. And I'm also not so sure=
=0D
about it. I'm just treating the pins as if I can set value + direction. How=
ever,=0D
the only thing that we can do is to PULL_LOW and set the pins in HIGH_Z. So=
,=0D
I dunno I'm doing the right thing. I wonder if I should just give the abili=
ty=0D
to configure the pins through FW with the .set_config hook and then just=0D
allow to read the pin level? The GPIO1 is also odd since is only the one=0D
that directly allows you to control the direction but then, again, you=0D
can just pull it low or high-z.=0D
=0D
One last comment is about lines length. I know some maintainer still want=0D
the 80 col limit but since I'm not so sure on the policy in hwmon I just=0D
went for 100. I'm pretty sure I'll need more iterations to get the driver=0D
in, so I'm happy to change it to 80 if required.=0D
