They're unrelated in their purpose, but adding ignore_resource_conflict 
creates an unusual situation that doesn't make it safe to use on its 
own. Because the driver registers two platform devices, the second one 
will start probing a random base address (0xFFF8).

It's not random though, because 0xFFFF & ~7 gets you there. But frankly, 
I don't know what normally lives there, so my initial opinion was that 
both changes should be a single commit to stop it87_find() from 
confirming that a device exists.

Just to be clear, currently, without the ignore_resource_conflict param, 
the driver just unregisters itself after the first of the 2 registers 
gives the ACPI conflict. So the issue of the second non-existant device, 
is not an issue.

Could separate the two patches completely, but ideally they're still 
together. What are your thoughts here?

My mistake, out of tree convention. Missed that the param right above it 
uses a 0 convention.

Will fix in v3.
