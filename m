Let me apologize and explain my perspective.

These AMD MSRs have been previously wired up in the turbostat tool, and
very recently another developer submitted a patch to wire up the package
energy counter MSR for use with perf.

Unlike the above, this driver is submitted by AMD. As I have noticed a
substantial issue (sum of core counters contradicting the package counter),
I have attempted to report it in this thread. Since AMD is submitting the
code, I was hoping to get their attention to the issue, and ideally get
some explanations about how the counters work and to what extent we can
expect them to be accurate.

I think most of the discussion about (not) ignoring initial counter
values was in part caused by misunderstanding exactly what issue I was
reporting. After all, it's not so important if the driver accurately
captures boot-time energy use, if the counters are not trustworthy.

I don't have an answer to your question (whether you should keep the
driver). I hope you see where I'm coming from. I'm not quite aware of
the history with coretemp driver, so if all this caused you extra
headaches, I apologize for my part in the mess.

Alexander
