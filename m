We have already discussed this problem years ago, see:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-hwmon/20160522152823.GA18331@roeck-us.net/

And also again this year:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-hwmon/20210528211037.2tnblovgb3rkcwnq@pali/

Basically there is no known firmware command to retrieve current status
yet. And both userspace and SMM/firmware itself can change state. So
kernel has no way how to retrieve current status and caching last value
cannot be used (due to userspace and firmware can change it).

Whole SMM API is undocumented and seems that Dell does not want to
provide any documentation for it.

I know that it is pity that we have no read functionality, but we have
to deal with it...

Maybe it would make sense to add comment into driver code, why attribute
is write-only...
