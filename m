Depends on the meaning of "fault". PMBus, for example, uses the "fault" terminology
to indicate that critical limits have been exceeded. That isn't a "fault" in the
terminology used by the hwmon subsystem. Violating a voltage/current/power range
isn't a fault. A shorted FET or temperature sensor, however, is a fault.

In that sense, if the output is turned off because a voltage / current / power
limit was violated, a write into the respective alarm register would be appropriate
to reset it if the condition doesn't auto-reset. It really all depends on the context.

We could also use in[01]_reset_history. While that is originally intended to reset
min/max voltage history, I think it makes sense to extend the meaning to include
fault history (even more so if that history includes over/undervoltage events).
Plus, there are other _reset_history attributes which could be used to reset
power/current/temperature history separately if that is supported by the chip.
