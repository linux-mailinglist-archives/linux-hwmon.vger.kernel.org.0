It can also be defined this way.
But platform firmware is generally ready to accept request when OS is 
running.
If platform isn't ready to accept the request from OSPM, the command 
will execute failed.
So it seems that the signature is a bit redundant if it is only used to 
indicate that the platform is ready to receive data.

Anyway, I follow spec, just does not understand the signature usage spec 
6.6 added.
