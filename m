If the GPIO is wired... There are a half a dozen different implementations
of this driver in the wild, and I remember one not using a GPIO
probably for a device without the enable gpio wired up to the SoC.
So I think the i2c way of enabling things is required at least
as a fallback option. So we need some if (enable_gpio) somewhere.

hmm, we have REGULATOR_MODE_FAST to maybe disable some pm. I have used
the autosuspend mechanism, so we do not do the time-consuming register cache
mechanism on every enable. But putting such into regulator core should be
more sane than having it in drivers.

Using standard helpers is in many places at least not so straight forward.
See the 6- in vposneg vsel.

vcom vsel has 9bits across two registers. So that is also odd.
vposneg has 2 bits used in a kind of RS flipflop mode for enable
if the enable pin is not available.

I would agree to remove the pm runtime stuff for now, so we can get the
basics in, and care about the optimazations later.

Regards,
Andreas
