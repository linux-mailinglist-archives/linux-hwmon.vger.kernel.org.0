MY WARM GREETINGS,

I AM MRS. VERONICA WILLIAMS , I DECIDED TO DONATE WHAT I HAVE TO YOU
FOR INVESTMENT TOWARDS THE GOOD WORK OF CHARITY ORGANIZATION, AND ALSO
TO HELP THE MOTHERLESS AND THE LESS PRIVILEGED ONES AND TO CARRY OUT A
CHARITABLE WORKS IN YOUR COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD ON MY BEHALF.

I AM DIAGNOSING OF THROAT CANCER, HOSPITALIZE FOR GOOD 2 YEARS AND
SOME MONTHS NOW AND QUITE OBVIOUS THAT I HAVE FEW DAYS TO LIVE, AND I
AM A WIDOW NO CHILD; I DECIDED TO WILL/DONATE THE SUM OF $5.8 MILLION
PRIVILEGE AND ALSO FORTH ASSISTANCE OF THE WIDOWS. AT THE MOMENT I
CANNOT TAKE ANY TELEPHONE CALLS RIGHT NOW DUE TO THE FACT THAT MY
RELATIVES (THAT HAVE SQUANDERED THE FUNDS FOR THIS PURPOSE BEFORE) ARE
AROUND ME AND MY HEALTH STATUS ALSO. I HAVE ADJUSTED MY WILL AND MY
BANK IS AWARE.

I HAVE WILLED THOSE PROPERTIES TO YOU BY QUOTING MY PERSONAL FILE
ROUTING AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION. AND I HAVE ALSO NOTIFIED THE BANK
THAT I AM WILLING THAT PROPERTIES TO YOU FOR A GOOD, EFFECTIVE AND
PRUDENT WORK. IT IS RIGHT TO SAY THAT I HAVE BEEN DIRECTED TO DO THIS
BY GOD. I WILL BE GOING IN FOR A SURGERY SOON AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT I MAKE THIS DONATION BEFORE UNDERGOING THIS SURGERY.

I WILL NEED YOUR SUPPORT TO MAKE THIS DREAM COME THROUGH, COULD YOU
LET ME KNOW YOUR INTEREST TO ENABLE ME GIVE YOU FURTHER INFORMATION.

AND I HEREBY ADVICE TO CONTACT ME BY THIS EMAIL ADDRESS.

WAITING YOUR REPLY
MRS. VERONICA WILLIAMS
