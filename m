You may also want to add a module parameter to override the WMI GUID
check as some devices do not support the fan reporting/tuning interface
despite having the WMI GUIDs.

Thanks, I will test it and add a Tested-by: tag then.

I am a little curious about where you got so many DSDTs. I sometimes
need DSDTs from other devices for cross-reference. I didn't see a
reference in the documentation. Am I missing something?
