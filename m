I am a bit at loss. what is the problem with having multiple _energy attributes
(energy1_input, energy2_input, ..., energy100_input) ?

You could do that, following the approach used by the k10temp driver. This is
really your call. The question in that case, though, would be why you would want
have a separate driver to start with and not just enhance the k10temp driver to
also report energy (and power consumption, though I understand that the registers
reporting it are not published).

_in is for voltages. Please don't tell me you plan to report voltages with this
driver. If so, please extend the k10temp driver instead.

This is a no-go.

I think this was mostly historic, but it preceeds my involvement with the
hwmon subsystem, so I don't really know.
