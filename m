Hi Guenter,

I am in similar position as you, my Linux work is unpaid and voluntary
and not subsidized as some of the other contributions are.

I am extremely grateful of the work that maintainers do and apologize
for the inconvenience that I may have caused.
Also I wish to thank you for the new form letter. I would have send a
pointer to my github location at first impulse however:

I forked torvalds/linux from github in the understanding that it would
allow me to create a proper documented pull request that could be
routed trough the proper channels.
However then i discovered after patching the file that I was not
allowed to create a pull request, which is quite annoying.
So I am looping in the Linuxfoundation in this mail in order to ask
them to please reconsider their current policy and allow the creation
of pull requests on gitgub/torvalds/linux . This would greatly reduce
the amount of overhead.
I would also argue that the github commenting system, the automated
build system, and the review system are quite good, and we have
definitely made some progress in that area since the invention of the
mailing-list.

I understand the master repositories should reside on kernel.org but
bringing in some of the feedback to the kernel via github could be
quite beneficial!

(Just occurred to me I can send a pointer to my own commit :
https://github.com/hvegh/linux/commit/00b3427269f731becbc10e9fe92046a6ad91eee8
 )


Kind regards,
Henk Vergonet
