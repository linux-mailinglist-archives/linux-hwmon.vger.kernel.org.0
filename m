I am confused now. Reading your reply:

"I am not sure if an implementation in the i2c core is desirable. It
looks quite invasive to me, and it won't solve the problem for all
devices since it isn't always a simple "wait <n> microseconds between
accesses". For example, some devices may require a wait after a write
but not after a read, or a wait only after certain commands (such as
commands writing to an EEPROM)."

I get the impression you don't prefer to have a generic mechanism in the
I2C core. This I share. Your response now sounds like you do support
that idea now?

> What other summary are you looking for ?

What the actual problem is with these devices. The cover letter only
mentions "issues with small command turn-around times". More details
would be nice. Is it between transfers? Or even between messages within
one transfer? Has it been tried to lower the bus frequency? Stuff like
this.

Is there a list of that somewhere? Or does it mean going through all the
drivers and see what they currently do?

Regards,
