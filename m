Hi Guenter,

First of all sorry for jumping late here. I'm totally with you here and we should
definitely only use the new API. For standard entries that will definitely
reduce the code size.

So, since we are talking about reducing code here, and looking to other DRM
drivers, and thinking about the needs on this new Xe driver, I'm wondering
if you would consider accepting 'frequency' as a standard hwmon attribute.

We would need it to be RW so we could use to put freq requests as well,
and possibly different types/domains and even throttle reasons on top.

So we could then try to unify all the drm drivers in a common drm-hwmon
layer putting an end in all abuses and deprecated users.

But before moving fwd with any proposal I'd like to hear your thoughts on
this 'frequency' block as standard attribute.

Thanks,
Rodrigo.
