Exactly. The only real recommendation I have at this time is for anyone
running Linux to stay away from boards with ITE chips.

Not that I know of, sorry. The EC is actually running inside the Super-IO
chip(s). I have no idea if and how it is accessible from Linux. Either case,
that would be even worse, since EC programming is board vendor specific.
