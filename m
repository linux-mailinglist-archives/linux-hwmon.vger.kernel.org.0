Understood. Could be considered a "safe" tool if in tree.

Just curious, how were you thinking of passing those commands? sysfs?
over i2c-dev?

Looking around, the documentation for configfs seemed like it would
could useful for this, but that's not in much use as I can see. (And
involves lots of text parsing)
