The patch 1/6 is not good to our platform.
Yeah, suggest to use gentle approach to do this if we have to clarify 
this signature.
After all, all client drivers work well before.

The reasons I say this largely depends on the firmware are as follows:
1> The previous ACPI spec did not clearly require that the platform 
firmware needs to fill in this signature first.
      The client driver working on these platform doesn't work anymore 
if use the way in patch 1/6.
2> We are not sure if some firmware verify this signature or clear this 
signature field in shared memory.

Agree.

Yeah, I found spec v6.5 just said how to compute it and didn't specify 
how to use it for platform and OSPM.
I saw the update of v6.6 for the signature field in "Generic 
Communications Channel Shared Memory Region" and "Extended PCC Subspace 
Shared Memory Region".
like: "The signature is populated by the platform and is verified by OSPM."
But please note v6.6 didn't say above words in "Reduced PCC Subspace 
Shared Memory Region".

I don't know why v6.6 specify like that.
After all. all PCC application parties (client drivers) in Linux have 
already filled this field.

According to my understanding of normal signature in communication,
it is generally filled by the initiator (sender) and verified by the 
responder (receiver).
In this way, the data is valid, and the signature is meaningful.

If it is only initialized by firmware, and OSPM verifies it, its 
lifecycle ends there.
I don't think this signature has much significance.

The signature field is just in shared memory and may be cleared due to 
some other exception.
Some similar case also need to be considered.
How to make it work better and more resilient may also be something we 
need to consider.
