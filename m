Historically hwmon devices were i2c devices so libsensors would use
the i2c client name as the device name, and still does as a fallback if
memory serves. Therefore whatever rule applies to hwmon names would
also apply to i2c names (in the context of hwmon devices) even though
this is not enforced.

No, my point is that from a userspace perspective it shouldn't matter
if the device comes from the OF tree or not. So the device name should
be the same, i.e. the i2c client should be named "jc42" always. That's
what happens for all other devices I checked, simply because it turns
out that their OF compatible string is in the form
<vendor_name>,<linux_i2c_client_name>, so when you strip the vendor
name you get the right name directly.

My knowledge of the OF subsystem is fairly limited though, so I have no
idea if it is possible to enforce a specific name like that at an early
stage. The proper name can't be guessed by i2c-core, so ideally the
conversion should be provided by the driver itself. I see that struct
of_device_id has a "name" field, can it be used for that purpose? If
not, I suppose the "data" field could be used for that.

I drew the same conclusion here, and your patch is definitely better
than nothing as it fixes a real problem, however it is not prefect due
to the reason explained above, plus the fact that it would break if the
driver ever supports more than one device type (say JEDEC releases JC43
tomorrow and we add support... you code forces the name to "jc42" even
if the OF name was something other than "jc-42.4-temp").
