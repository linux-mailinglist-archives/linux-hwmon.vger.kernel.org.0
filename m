The impact of out-of-order accesses to priv->updated is indeed minimal.

That said, smp_load_acquire() and smp_store_release() were meant to
prevent reordering at runtime, and only affect architectures other than
x86.  READ_ONCE() and WRITE_ONCE() would already prevent reordering from
compiler optimizations, and x86 provides the load-acquire/store-release
semantics by default.

But the reordering issue is not a concern to me, I got carried away when
adding READ_ONCE()/WRITE_ONCE().  While smp_load_acquire() and
smp_store_release() make the code work more like I intend it to, they
are (small) costs we can spare.

I still think that READ_ONCE()/WRITE_ONCE() are necessary, including for
priv->updated.  Do you agree?

Thanks,
Jonas

P.S. Architectures other than x86 are admittedly a niche case for this
driver, but I would not rule them out.  Not only can the cooler be
adapted to mount on silicon other than mainstream Intel/AMD CPUs (and
there even exists a first-party adapter for graphics cards), but it can
trivially also be controlled by a secondary, possibly non-x86, system.
