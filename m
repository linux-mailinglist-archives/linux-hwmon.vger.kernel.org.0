This isn't working...from what I've read we cannot just simply overwrite existing schemas.

Krzysztof, Guenter what I should do? Is there a way to match with uint32-array schema and with
schema that allows items in array to be below 0 (seems impossible to me)? I've tried a lot of
combinations today without any luck. Any helpful tips? Thanks!
