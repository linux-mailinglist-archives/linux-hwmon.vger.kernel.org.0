I know that hwmon sysfs are rw but if driver cannot provide correct read
value then it is better to do not report it.

Well, maybe state changed in time (it is 5 years since that email) but
there are still more older versions of i8k userspace tools and some of
them used to issue SMM calls. Personally, I have used them (prior
introducing kernel support) and I can expect that other people who wrote
other scripts may have them in their inittab (or converted to systemd
equivalent). So it is better to not expect that something is not used.

Whole SMM stuff is fragile for various reasons...

Also another issue is that initial value is unknown. Because we do not
know if BIOS fan control is enabled or disabled.

I was told that in past BIOS fan control was old Dell laptops was
disabled, so if people adds old laptops into whilelist it would mean
that we even do not guess state of BIOS fan control status.
