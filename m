The DSDT would have to provide all properties, not just the VID modes.
At the very least that would have to be the number of pages, data formats,
vrm version, and the supported attributes per page. It should be possible
to also add m/b/R information for each of the sensor classes, but I guess
the actual implementation could be postponed until it is needed.

This could all be done through the existing generic driver (pmbus.c);
it would not really require a new driver. ACPI/DSDT could provide firmware
properties, and pmbus.c could read those using device_property API
functions (eg device_property_read_u32(dev, "vrm-mode")). Would that work
for you ?

Thanks,
Guenter
