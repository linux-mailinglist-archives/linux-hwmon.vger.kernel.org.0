It looks like you fund a better source of support than me. All I ever
got was "we do not support Linux".

Anyway, please find a better term than BIOSOPEN. I don't really care
too much what it is as long as it doesn't suggest to be related to
something that it isn't. FEAT_NOCONF or something similar might do.

Well, again, BIOS suggests that the BIOS is involved, which would make
it board specific.
