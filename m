Fair point.

The force_id change is warranted on its own, even without the 
ignore_resource_conflict because:
  - Chipsets will reply with all 1s if no LPC peripheral is connected
    Useful for lots of systems with a single device
  - IT87 will reply with all 1s if you don't enter config space correctly
    Useful for those who override with a known id, but the device is
    quite different
  - The driver supports 2 sio devices, but the use of force_id is
    mostly a single-device use case. It doesn't support forcing two
    different devices, so it's safe to assume a non-existent device
    is not expected for those users.

My systems run mostly tainted Kernels and I can even grab the temps with 
a shell script, so I'm not worried about my systems, but they're the
only ones I can test with :)

The kernel parameter is an option that works, but it's a bit more
technical for general users to update their bootloader and change
modprobe config at the same time. This whole patch is about making
the it87 more usable with less compile/install work.


I can prep v3 with both changes if that's still a good approach.
