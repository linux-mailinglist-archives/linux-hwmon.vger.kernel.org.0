It was Nuvoton support that told me that NCT6799D-R was a customer-
specific chip, but "very similar" to 6796d-S.

The point here was to specify the relevant chip ids and to say that the
driver treats both the same way, so I can rephrase it to say "driver
treats both the same way" maybe?

However, I'm somewhat sure the temperature sources on 6799d-R use one of
the reserved values when setup through the bios.

Do you know which board had the NCT6796-R, it seems the R suffix is
"customer-specific"?

Of course:

Will update.
