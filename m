Right this is all working as designed, it is just that Microsoft has
gone a pretty custom route with the Surface devices.

Guenter another way of looking at this is if there were 2 ACPI devices
describing the fan vs the temperature monitoring capabilities that too
would result in 2 drivers even though the underlying ACPI AML code
might end up talking to the same monitoring-IC in the end.

I'll go and merge patch 3/3 of this series. I'll leave merging
1/3 and 2/3 up to the hwmon subsystem of course.

Regards,

Hans
